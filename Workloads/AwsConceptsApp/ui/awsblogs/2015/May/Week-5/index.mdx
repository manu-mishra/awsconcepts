          <p>Private content can be served through Amazon CloudFront in two ways: through signed URLs or signed cookies. For information about which approach to choose, see Choosing Between Signed URLs and Signed Cookies. The AWS SDK for .NET includes an Amazon.CloudFront.AmazonCloudFrontUrlSigner utility class that can be used to generate signed URLs. Based on a customer request, [...]</p>
