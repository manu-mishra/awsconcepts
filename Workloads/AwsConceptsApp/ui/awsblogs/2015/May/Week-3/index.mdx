          <p>Let&#8217;s face it&#8212;not all APIs were created equal. For example, you may be really interested in knowing when any of your Amazon EC2 instances are terminated (ec2:TerminateInstance), but less interested when an object is put in an Amazon S3 bucket (s3:PutObject).

          <p>AWS OpsWorks customers frequently request the ability to run arbitrary commands. And while OpsWorks sets up and manages the Amazon EC2 instances your application runs on and manages users&#8217; access to your instances, it doesn&#8217;t allow running arbitrary commands.
