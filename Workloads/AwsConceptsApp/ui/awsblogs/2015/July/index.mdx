          <p>Why does AWS have so many data storage options? Which one is right for me? These are commonly asked customer questions. In this three-part blog series, I will attempt to provide some clarity. In the first part, I discussed the basics of high availability and how redundancy is a common way of achieving it. I also briefly mentioned that bringing redundancy to the data tier introduces new challenges. In this second part of the blog series, I discuss some of those challenges and common tradeoffs that you need to take into consideration while overcoming them.</p>
