          <p>AWS IoT Core supports billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and other devices reliably and securely. AWS IoT Core requires X.509 certificates for authentication, but the X.509 standard consumes battery power, negating LPWANs advantage in that area. Telefonica developed a data bridge to enable IoT devices to connect securely to AWS IoT Core, while preserving the long range, low cost, and low power advantages of LPWAN connections.</p>

          <p>When streaming data comes in from a variety of sources, organizations should have the capability to ingest this data quickly and join it with other relevant business data to derive insights and provide positive experiences to customers. Learn how you can build and run a fully managed Apache Kafka-compatible Amazon MSK to ingest streaming data, and explore how to use a Kafka connect application to persist this data to Snowflake. This enables businesses to derive near real-time insights into end users experiences and feedback.</p>

          <p>You may have heard the saying that the best ETL is no ETL. Amazon Redshift now makes this possible with Federated Query. In its initial release, this feature lets you query data in Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL using Amazon Redshift external schemas. Federated Query also exposes the metadata from these source databases through system views and driver APIs, which allows business intelligence tools like Tableau and Amazon Quicksight to connect to Amazon Redshift and query data in PostgreSQL without having to make local copies.</p>

One of the best ways to tackle complicated data integration is through a data lake: a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics, such as data warehousing, big data processing, or operational analytics, to gain insights and guide better business decisions.</p>

          <p>You can now configure Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) in the Tabular or Multidimensional mode on Amazon RDS for SQL Server. SSAS works in the Single-AZ configuration for both Standard and Enterprise editions using either the 2016, 2017 or 2019 SQL Server Major version.
If you run SSAS on Amazon EC2, you can save on costs by supporting SSAS directly on Amazon RDS for SQL Server and consolidating those workloads to run on the same RDS DB instance as your SQL Server database. However, you must account for a performance impact if you decide to consolidate.</p>

          <p>Finding IT budget to drive new initiatives can be a challenge, especially for public sector organizations. Most public sector organizations use IT funds for foundational initiatives such as disaster recovery, supporting critical applications, or delivering key collaboration tools. As new priorities emerge, organizations might not have the funds to adopt new workloads or advanced technologies that address urgent, new, or emerging needs. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cost optimization tools, services, and guidance to help public sector organizations lower cloud costs so they can better serve their stakeholders and achieve their missions.</p>

          <p>Last December, AWS announced the expansion of its collaboration with the U.S. NOAA to make environmental data easier to access and use through the Big Data Program. Users can now access new, authoritative NOAA data on AWS without needing to download and store their own copies. Researchers and entrepreneurs can deploy compute resources on-demand in the cloud, perform analysis quickly and efficiently, and save costs by letting researchers ask more questions and experiment more easily. One of the foundational datasets now available on AWS through this collaboration is Himawari-8, the Japan Meteorological Agencys satellite dataset.</p>

AWS Data Wrangler is an open-source Python package that extends the power of Pandas library to AWS and connects DataFrames and AWS data-related services (such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon EMR). For more information about what you can build by using this data lake, see the associated public Jupyter notebook on GitHub.</p>

          <p>In this post, we discuss how to leverage the automatic code generation process in AWS Glue ETL to simplify common data manipulation tasks, such as data type conversion and flattening complex structures. We also explore using AWS Glue Workflows to build and orchestrate data pipelines of varying complexity. Lastly, we look at how you can leverage the power of SQL, with the use of AWS Glue ETL and Glue Data Catalog, to query and transform your data.</p>
