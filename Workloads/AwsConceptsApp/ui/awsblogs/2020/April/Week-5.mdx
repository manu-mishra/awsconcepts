          <p>Last December, AWS announced the expansion of its collaboration with the U.S. NOAA to make environmental data easier to access and use through the Big Data Program. Users can now access new, authoritative NOAA data on AWS without needing to download and store their own copies. Researchers and entrepreneurs can deploy compute resources on-demand in the cloud, perform analysis quickly and efficiently, and save costs by letting researchers ask more questions and experiment more easily. One of the foundational datasets now available on AWS through this collaboration is Himawari-8, the Japan Meteorological Agencys satellite dataset.</p>

Imperva protects web applications and data assets, and in this post we examine how you can use SQL to analyze big data directly, or to pre-process the data for further analysis by machine learning. Youll also learn about the benefits and limitations of using SQL, and see examples of clustering and data extraction.</p>
