If you run SSAS on Amazon EC2, you can save on costs by supporting SSAS directly on Amazon RDS for SQL Server and consolidating those workloads to run on the same RDS DB instance as your SQL Server database. However, you must account for a performance impact if you decide to consolidate.</p>

          <p>Finding IT budget to drive new initiatives can be a challenge, especially for public sector organizations. Most public sector organizations use IT funds for foundational initiatives such as disaster recovery, supporting critical applications, or delivering key collaboration tools. As new priorities emerge, organizations might not have the funds to adopt new workloads or advanced technologies that address urgent, new, or emerging needs. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cost optimization tools, services, and guidance to help public sector organizations lower cloud costs so they can better serve their stakeholders and achieve their missions.</p>

          <p>Introduction Kubernetes enables machine learning teams to run training jobs distributed across fleets of powerful GPU instances like Amazon EC2 P3, reducing training time from days to hours. However, distributed training comes with limitations compared to the more traditional microservice based applications typically associated with Kubernetes. Distributed training jobs are not fault tolerant, and a [...]</p>

          <p>Every Board of Directors should be asking their executive team how they plan to deal with digital disruption. Even if a company is not yet facing disruption, it surely soon will be. And leaving it up to chance or just proceeding with the status quo is not a viable alternative.</p>
