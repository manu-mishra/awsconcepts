          <p>AWS IoT Core supports billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints and other devices reliably and securely. AWS IoT Core requires X.509 certificates for authentication, but the X.509 standard consumes battery power, negating LPWANs advantage in that area. Telefonica developed a data bridge to enable IoT devices to connect securely to AWS IoT Core, while preserving the long range, low cost, and low power advantages of LPWAN connections.</p>

          <p>Data is an organizations critical asset, which is why safeguarding it against ransomware attacks, natural disasters, emergencies, or technical failures is a top priority. Legacy data storage, such as tape, makes sharing and protecting data costly and time consuming. AWS released a series of educational webinars and whiteboarding videos that discuss how to raise the bar on data protection in the AWS Cloud.</p>

          <p>You may have heard the saying that the best ETL is no ETL. Amazon Redshift now makes this possible with Federated Query. In its initial release, this feature lets you query data in Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL using Amazon Redshift external schemas. Federated Query also exposes the metadata from these source databases through system views and driver APIs, which allows business intelligence tools like Tableau and Amazon Quicksight to connect to Amazon Redshift and query data in PostgreSQL without having to make local copies.</p>

          <p>Data related to healthcare, in both volume and variety, is undergoing a tremendous expansion. One of the best ways to tackle complicated data integration is through a data lake: a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics, such as data warehousing, big data processing, or operational analytics, to gain insights and guide better business decisions.</p>
