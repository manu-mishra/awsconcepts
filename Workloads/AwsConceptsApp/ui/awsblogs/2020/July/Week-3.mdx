          <p>Change Data Capture (CDC) is the technique of systematically tracking incremental change in data at the source, and subsequently applying these changes at the target to maintain synchronization. You can implement CDC in diverse scenarios using a variety of tools and technologies. Here, Cognizant uses a hypothetical retailer with a customer loyalty program to demonstrate how CDC can synchronize incremental changes in customer activity with the main body of data already stored about a customer.</p>
