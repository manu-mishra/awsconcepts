          <p>With Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can query the data in your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data lake using a central AWS Glue metastore from your Amazon Redshift cluster. This capability extends your petabyte-scale Amazon Redshift data warehouse to unbounded data storage limits, which allows you to scale to exabytes of data cost-effectively. Like Amazon EMR, you get the benefits of open data formats and inexpensive storage, and you can scale out to thousands of Redshift Spectrum nodes to pull data, filter, project, aggregate, group, and sort. Like Amazon Athena, Redshift Spectrum is serverless and theres nothing to provision or manage. You only pay $5 for every 1 TB of data scanned. This post discusses how to configure Amazon Redshift security to enable fine grained access control using role chaining to achieve high-fidelity user-based permission management.</p>

          <p>VMware Cloud on AWS allows customers to seamlessly extend their Layer 2 on-premises networks to the cloud. This is important because you can migrate virtual machines from on-premises Layer 2 networks to VMware Cloud on AWS without changing IP addresses. Learn about the architectural considerations for extending your on-premises networks to VMware Cloud on AWS using HCX and the NSX Autonomous Standalone Edge, either via AWS Direct Connect or through the public internet.</p>

          <p>Government agencies have accelerated their transition to the cloud over the last few years, and COVID-19 has accelerated the urgency and pace of that move. A benefit of moving to the cloud is increased security. But to realize this, new infrastructure must be implemented and managed correctly, using best practices and the right technologies. Working with our partners, AWS has helped dozens of solutions accelerate their FedRAMP authorizations. There are more than 100 FedRAMP-authorized solutions running on AWS.</p>
