          <p>Unravelling the relationship between COVID-19 and air pollution is vital for protecting public health. For example, preliminary works suggest that those living in environments with polluted air are significantly more likely to be adversely affected by COVID-19. At the same time, air pollution is already known to cause an estimated one out of every eight deaths globally. The decrease in human activities due to COVID-19 lockdowns across the world has people wondering how air pollution levels are being impactedand what valuable public health and policy lessons we can learn.</p>

          <p>The amount of time invested in achieving an AWS Certification is no small feat. Its important for individuals to get recognized for this hard work. Since November 2019, AWS Partners have been able to record the AWS Certifications achieved by employees in their organization, but individuals who work for AWS Partners must provide consent for this information to be shared with their employer. Doing so can provide significant growth opportunities for both the individual and APN Partner organization.</p>
