          <p>Unravelling the relationship between COVID-19 and air pollution is vital for protecting public health. For example, preliminary works suggest that those living in environments with polluted air are significantly more likely to be adversely affected by COVID-19. At the same time, air pollution is already known to cause an estimated one out of every eight deaths globally. The decrease in human activities due to COVID-19 lockdowns across the world has people wondering how air pollution levels are being impactedand what valuable public health and policy lessons we can learn.</p>

          <p>With Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can query the data in your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data lake using a central AWS Glue metastore from your Amazon Redshift cluster. This capability extends your petabyte-scale Amazon Redshift data warehouse to unbounded data storage limits, which allows you to scale to exabytes of data cost-effectively. Like Amazon EMR, you get the benefits of open data formats and inexpensive storage, and you can scale out to thousands of Redshift Spectrum nodes to pull data, filter, project, aggregate, group, and sort. Like Amazon Athena, Redshift Spectrum is serverless and theres nothing to provision or manage. You only pay $5 for every 1 TB of data scanned. This post discusses how to configure Amazon Redshift security to enable fine grained access control using role chaining to achieve high-fidelity user-based permission management.</p>

          <p>Government agencies have accelerated their transition to the cloud over the last few years, and COVID-19 has accelerated the urgency and pace of that move. A benefit of moving to the cloud is increased security. But to realize this, new infrastructure must be implemented and managed correctly, using best practices and the right technologies. Working with our partners, AWS has helped dozens of solutions accelerate their FedRAMP authorizations. There are more than 100 FedRAMP-authorized solutions running on AWS.</p>

You can implement CDC in diverse scenarios using a variety of tools and technologies. Here, Cognizant uses a hypothetical retailer with a customer loyalty program to demonstrate how CDC can synchronize incremental changes in customer activity with the main body of data already stored about a customer.</p>

          <p>As the COVID-19 outbreak began, advocates and public health officials grew concerned for the more than half a million people experiencing homelessness.

This prompted many communities to implement interventions to reduce the risk of exposure for people experiencing homelessness. AWS customers and partners have acted with compassion and care to assist the most vulnerable individuals across our communities. Here are a few ways they are using cloud technology to support those in need.</p>

          <p>The rapid acceleration of digital transformation has raised expectations for efficient and effective engagement with service providers. Many expect the same engagement with government agencies as they do from consumer services such as video-on-demand, ecommerce, and online food delivery. In Australia, the government is prioritising delivering services through technology in a fast and secure way. The CSCP was closed in March 2020 and the ISM was updated to remove the requirement to select services from the Certified Cloud Services List (CCSL). However, the discontinuation of the CSCP does not alter Amazon Web Services (AWS) commitment to help Australian Government agencies innovate rapidly and securely.</p>

          <p>As a physical oceanographer focused on remote sensing, Dr. Chelle Gentemann, senior scientist at Farallon Institute, has worked for over 20 years on retrievals of ocean temperature from space. She uses measurements of sea surface temperature from satellites to understand how the ocean impacts our lives. Chelles work requires analysis of large volumes of data, which requires access to large data storage and computational resources. Although most large research institutions can secure those IT resources, that is not the case for smaller organizations or underserved communities around the world. As part of theAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative, we invited Dr. Gentemann to share her perspective on the value of hosting high-resolution climate data on AWS.</p>

          <p>There are many ways to connect your data centers to Amazon Web Services. This blog post answers a few common questions that customers ask us when trying to build a communications path over AWS Direct Connect (DX). In particular, how to create active passive Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connections with AWS over Direct Connect. To [...]</p>

          <p>Nowadays, risk of spreading disease is a key concern in hospitals, where doctors, nurses and other caregivers are on the front lines helping patients. Hospitals have started using robots in daily operations such as contactless delivery and room disinfection to reduce risk of spreading disease. As the need for robots in healthcare grows, better tools are needed to build, test, and deploy robotics applications quickly and safely. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has developed a Gazebo simulated Hospital World and published it as open source so that robotics companies within the Healthcare industry can more easily test their robots in a simulated hospital environment. In this blog, I will provide an overview of the hospital and share my experience using it to test a PR2 robot, including software failures that I encountered that you may find helpful.</p>

          <p>At AWS, we understand migrating your data is not trivial, especially migrating out of tenured, familiar data storage solutions. It can involve serious and tedious work in designing, planning, and executing your data migration project plan, plus having a contingency plan in place in case of any hiccups. There are both technical and business risks [...]</p>
