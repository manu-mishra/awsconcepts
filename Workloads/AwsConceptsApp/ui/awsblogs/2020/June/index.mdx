          <p>The breadth of challenges that can be addressed by overhead imagery is broad and continues to grow as new and improved sensors are deployed. To make the best use of this data, you need to have high-quality training datadata that you know is true (often called ground truth data) so that your algorithms can learn from it. A lack of this high-quality labeled training data continues to impede progress in many areas of remote sensing analytics, including machine learning. Two of the SpaceNet collaborators, Capella Space and AWS, are providing access to a unique dataset to help foster innovation in geospatial-based artificial intelligence. Learn more about Earth observation data, the SpaceNet 6 Challenge, and available datasets.</p>

In this blog, we demonstrate how to enable FIPS mode in Amazon Linux 2 and verify that unauthorized cryptographic functions are not being used in OpenSSL or the OpenSSH server.</p>

          <p>Keeping your Linux system up to date with the latest operating system and application software patches is one of the most effective ways to strengthen system security. Enterprises sometimes neglect to install the latest security updates because most kernel upgrades and security patches require a system reboot, which means downtime and waiting for reboot cycles. KernelCare from CloudLinux can live patch Amazon EC2 instances based on AWS Graviton2 Arm64 processors.</p>

          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that public sector organizations need modern infrastructure, capabilities and controls to overcome the disruption caused by global health outbreaks. Organizations that embraced cloud services proved more responsive. They were able to continue operating remotely and serving their customers and citizens, demonstrating agility, scalability, and speed. In How Governments Can Build Resilience in a New Normal: Emerging Practices from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, a new policy paper from the AWS Institute, we outline how organizations can use the cloud to recover from the disruption that the virus brought, as well as become more resilient for future challenges.</p>

          <p>Amazon EMR web interfaces are hosted on the master node of an EMR cluster. When you launch an EMR cluster in a private subnet, the EMR master node doesnt have a public DNS record. The web interfaces hosted in a private subnet arent easily accessible outside the subnet. You can use an Application Load Balancer (ALB), launched in a public subnet, as an HTTPS proxy to access EMR web interfaces over the internet without requiring SSH tunneling through a bastion host. This approach greatly simplifies accessing EMR web interfaces. This post outlines how to use an ALB to securely access EMR web interfaces over the internet for an EMR cluster launched in a private subnet.</p>

          <p>We often have data processing requirements in which we need to merge multiple datasets with varying data ingestion frequencies. Some of these datasets are ingested one time in full, received infrequently, and always used in their entirety, whereas other datasets are incremental, received at certain intervals, and joined with the full datasets to generate output. To address this requirement, this post demonstrates how to build an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline using AWS Glue.</p>

Our primary ETL job reads the newly added raw event data from Amazon S3, processes it using Apache Spark, and writes the results to our Amazon Redshift data warehouse. AWS Glue plays a critical role in our ability to scale on demand. After careful evaluation and testing, we concluded that AWS Glue ETL jobs meet all our needs and free us from procuring and managing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The First Street Foundation is dedicated to communicating the flood and inundation risks posed by a changing environment, with an emphasis on allowing Americans to discover and understand those risks. By building awareness, our hope is that every individual is empowered to take steps to reduce their risk exposure to flooding, as well as that of their communitiestoday and in the future. First Street created a nationwide assessment of flood risk for the CONUS and DC, and is now sharing that assessment through Flood Factor.</p>

          <p>This post demonstrates how to extend the Lake Formation security model to QuickSight users and groups, which allows data lake administrators to manage data catalog resource permissions centrally from one console. As organizations embark on the journey to secure their data lakes with Lake Formation, having the ability to centrally manage fine-grained permissions for QuickSight authors can extend the data governance and enforcement of security controls at the data consumption (business intelligence) layer. You can enable these fine-grained permissions for QuickSight users and groups at the database, table, or column level, and theyre reflected in the Athena dataset in QuickSight.</p>

These trusted AWS Partners have passed a technical validation for following AWS service best practices, and have proven success delivering AWS services like Direct Connect to customers.</p>

With this donation, we hope to bring entertainment and joy to anywhere from 75 to 200 kids per day per hospital.</p>
