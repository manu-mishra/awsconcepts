          <p>Spark is a distributed computing framework that added new features like Pandas UDF by using PyArrow. You can leverage Spark for distributed and advanced machine learning model lifecycle capabilities to build massive-scale products with a bunch of models in production. Learn how Perion Network implemented a model lifecycle capability to distribute the training and testing stages with few lines of PySpark code. This capability improved the performance and accuracy of Perions ML models.</p>

          <p>The breadth of challenges that can be addressed by overhead imagery is broad and continues to grow as new and improved sensors are deployed. To make the best use of this data, you need to have high-quality training datadata that you know is true (often called ground truth data) so that your algorithms can learn from it. A lack of this high-quality labeled training data continues to impede progress in many areas of remote sensing analytics, including machine learning. Two of the SpaceNet collaborators, Capella Space and AWS, are providing access to a unique dataset to help foster innovation in geospatial-based artificial intelligence. Learn more about Earth observation data, the SpaceNet 6 Challenge, and available datasets.</p>

In the past five decades, large wildfire frequency and the area destroyed have risen by more than four and six times, respectively. The increased risk posed by wildfires has prompted scientists to try to assess wildfire risk to help inform whether to move people to safety before disastrous wildfires occur.</p>

It is the current United States and Canadian government standard, and is applicable to systems that are required to be compliant with Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) or Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). In this blog, we demonstrate how to enable FIPS mode in Amazon Linux 2 and verify that unauthorized cryptographic functions are not being used in OpenSSL or the OpenSSH server.</p>

          <p>Keeping your Linux system up to date with the latest operating system and application software patches is one of the most effective ways to strengthen system security. Enterprises sometimes neglect to install the latest security updates because most kernel upgrades and security patches require a system reboot, which means downtime and waiting for reboot cycles. KernelCare from CloudLinux can live patch Amazon EC2 instances based on AWS Graviton2 Arm64 processors.</p>
