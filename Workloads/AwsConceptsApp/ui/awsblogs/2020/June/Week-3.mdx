In How Governments Can Build Resilience in a New Normal: Emerging Practices from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, a new policy paper from the AWS Institute, we outline how organizations can use the cloud to recover from the disruption that the virus brought, as well as become more resilient for future challenges.</p>

          <p>Amazon EMR web interfaces are hosted on the master node of an EMR cluster. When you launch an EMR cluster in a private subnet, the EMR master node doesnt have a public DNS record. The web interfaces hosted in a private subnet arent easily accessible outside the subnet. You can use an Application Load Balancer (ALB), launched in a public subnet, as an HTTPS proxy to access EMR web interfaces over the internet without requiring SSH tunneling through a bastion host. This approach greatly simplifies accessing EMR web interfaces. This post outlines how to use an ALB to securely access EMR web interfaces over the internet for an EMR cluster launched in a private subnet.</p>
