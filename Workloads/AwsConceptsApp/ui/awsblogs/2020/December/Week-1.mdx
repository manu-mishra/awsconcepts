Often, nonprofits evaluate efficiency based on their operating expenses. For many, this means turning to the cloud to eliminate the upfront costs of buying servers and building data centers. With the cloud, nonprofits can better understand their bills, uncover foundational strategies for optimizing costs, set up budget alerts, and track costs and usage so they only spend on resources that they need.</p>

          <p>Did you know that the unemployment rate for the formerly incarcerated is five times higher than the general population? The implications of this stat are significantaffecting not only an individuals livelihoodbut also their family and future. Research shows that post-release unemployment is the most significant predictor of eventual recidivism. Thats why programs like Columbia Universitys Justice Through Code are so important. Justice Through Code is a free, semester-long program, developed in partnership with the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise at Columbia Business School and the Center for Justice at Columbia University, providing formerly incarcerated individuals with technical and interpersonal skills training, mentorship, and job placement support.</p>

There are no costs in using the Well-Architected Tool. Developers and architects can use it to improve their applications or get visibility into multiple workloads.</p>
