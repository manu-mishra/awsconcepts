          <p>For most machine learning startups, the most valuable resource is time. They want to focus on developing the unique aspects of their business, not managing the dynamic compute infrastructure needed to run their applications. Productionizing machine leaning should be easier, and thats where AWS comes in. In this blog post and corresponding GitHub repo, you will learn how to bring a pre-trained model to Amazon SageMaker to have production-ready model serving in under 15 minutes.</p>
