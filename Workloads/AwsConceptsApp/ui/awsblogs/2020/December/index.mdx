Often, nonprofits evaluate efficiency based on their operating expenses. For many, this means turning to the cloud to eliminate the upfront costs of buying servers and building data centers. With the cloud, nonprofits can better understand their bills, uncover foundational strategies for optimizing costs, set up budget alerts, and track costs and usage so they only spend on resources that they need.</p>

          <p>Did you know that the unemployment rate for the formerly incarcerated is five times higher than the general population? The implications of this stat are significantaffecting not only an individuals livelihoodbut also their family and future. Research shows that post-release unemployment is the most significant predictor of eventual recidivism. Thats why programs like Columbia Universitys Justice Through Code are so important. Justice Through Code is a free, semester-long program, developed in partnership with the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise at Columbia Business School and the Center for Justice at Columbia University, providing formerly incarcerated individuals with technical and interpersonal skills training, mentorship, and job placement support.</p>

          <p>To help accelerate firms building SaaS solutions on AWS, the SaaS Factory team led an effort to build a new AWS Well-Architected SaaS Lens. With this release, AWS Partners have another tool to help customers with SaaS workloads on AWS. The SaaS Lens can be applied to existing workloads, or used for new workloads you define in the tool. There are no costs in using the Well-Architected Tool. Developers and architects can use it to improve their applications or get visibility into multiple workloads.</p>

          <p>For most machine learning startups, the most valuable resource is time. They want to focus on developing the unique aspects of their business, not managing the dynamic compute infrastructure needed to run their applications. Productionizing machine leaning should be easier, and thats where AWS comes in. In this blog post and corresponding GitHub repo, you will learn how to bring a pre-trained model to Amazon SageMaker to have production-ready model serving in under 15 minutes.</p>

          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic pressed organizations to virtualize events that would have previously been held in person, like town halls, school board meetings, public health announcements, and more. While larger organizations may have existing media departments, smaller organizations have had to find ways to utilize social media and other consumer-grade resources to stream these events online. This post walks through how to use AWS Elemental MediaLive to stream to Facebook Live and YouTube Live using an AWS CloudFormation stack to stand up resources automatically.</p>

This includes things like being able to send notifications to users, providing a single log-in for government services, or publishing public health information in the wake of a pandemic. The AWS Government Transformation Team is here to help. We highlight available solutions and build new open source solutions that governments can leverage. Before developing new software, establishing a foundation with a sound design system is an important first step so our solutions are consistent, accessible, and simple to use. Read on to learn more about why starting with an open source design system is important and how we selected one for the software weve built and will build in the future.</p>

          <p>Sometimes we technologists can be a bit too clever for our own good. The term technical debt, attributed to Ward Cunningham in a 1992 OOPSLA conference speech, may be an example. We use the term often these days, generally in the context of justifying investments in nonfunctional aspects of IT; that is, investments intended to [...]</p>

          <p>The default behavior for stream processing in Lambda functions enables entire batches of messages to succeed or fail. You can also use batch bisecting functionality to retry batches iteratively if a single message fails. Now with custom checkpoints, you have more control over handling failed messages.</p>

This makes it easier to calculate sums, averages, and counts on values across multiple batches of data.</p>

          <p>The cloud can help researchers process complex workloads, store and analyze enormous amounts of data, collaborate globally, and accelerate research and innovation. For research IT, Amazon Web Services (AWS) can help build scalable, cost-effective, and flexible environments while still maintaining the governance and guardrails for security and compliance. Following best practices, AWS allows for centralized management of resources, improved security and compliance of research workloads, and can save costs and accelerate innovation. What are some common questions from research IT customers?</p>

          <p>On the night before Christmas, children around the world wonder when Santa is coming to town. For the 65th consecutive year, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) will put its world-class technology to work to keep an eye on Santas whereabouts. Beginning at 6:00 AM EST on December 24, families can check on Santas location by calling the toll-free number 1-877-Hi-NORAD (1-877-446-6723). AWS is supporting NORAD by helping their volunteers answer as many calls as possible through Amazon Connect, an omnichannel cloud contact center service. By transferring calls through Amazon Connect, NORAD staff and representatives will be able to answer calls from their homes or offices, supporting those on site at the NORAD Tracks Santa Operations Center.</p>
