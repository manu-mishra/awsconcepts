          <p>Mainframe workloads are often tightly-coupled legacy monoliths with millions of lines of code, and customers want to modernize them for business agility. Manually rewriting a legacy application for a cloud-native architecture requires lots of re-engineering. See how AWS Blu Age transformed a typical mainframe CICS application to AWS containers and AWS Lambda functions. Youll also learn how to increase mainframe workload agility with refactoring to serverless and containers.</p>

So what can technology do to make farming and agriculture more sustainable and climate-resilient? How can we make sure crops are high quality and high yield? How do we make sure that we get them to market when they are fresh? How can we improve the way farmers interact with each other? Our customers are helping to answer these questions.</p>

          <p>The deadline to move to SAP S/4HANA was recently extended to 2027. Many companies are in the early stages of evaluating how and when to make this upgrade. For many organizations, the decision to adopt the cloud for their enterprise deployments is in the rear view mirror. Thus, migrating SAP to the cloud first, and then pursuing the upgrade to S/4HANA later, may be the best course of action for your company.</p>

          <p>Cloud-based technologies allow organizations like governments to build a new application on existing services on the internet that offers open and documented APIs to deliver reliable data. These services have an authentication model so that new users verify their identity before accessing, even if its offered at no cost. There are three components in this scenario: a service provider, an end user, and an application that needs to access user data. The key technology here is OAuth. OAuth is a standard that enables access delegation.</p>

          <p>Enterprises often choose to mask, remove, or encrypt sensitive data in the ETL step to minimize the risk of sensitive data becoming stored, logged, accessible, or breached from their data lake or data warehouse. Xplentys ETL and ELT platform allows customers to quickly and easily prepare their data for analytics using a simple-to-use data integration cloud service. Xplentys global service uses AWS KMS to create and control the keys used to encrypt or digitally sign your data.</p>

          <p>AWS License Manager streamlines the process of bringing software vendor licenses to the cloud. As you build your applications in AWS that use third party licenses or move your on-premises workloads to AWS, you can save costs by using bring-your-own-license (BYOL) opportunities. This can be done by re-purposing your existing license inventory for use with [...]</p>

          <p>For climate change adaptation and resilience, it is important to assess the risks associated with the impacts of climate change and then understand and take action to mitigate those risks. Since 1980, the U.S. has experienced 258 weather and climate disasters where the overall damage costs reached or exceeded $1 billion. As floods become more frequent and costly and natural hazards and climate change impact physical building assets, business continuity, and asset values, big data and analytical technology can be used to create high-tech risk assessments and economic loss estimations.</p>

          <p>To nurture future diverse leaders in technology during Black History Month, AWS worked across the United States to educate the next generation of students on cloud computing, cloud career opportunities, and how to excel in the technology industry. AWS Educate and the Americas-based AWS solutions architecture team worked together at Bowie State University during a two-day, student-centered event near Amazon HQ2. Almost 150 students from the technology and security, computer science, and management of information systems departments came to learn about the AWS builder culture, AWS Educate resources, and early-career technical roles through Tech U.</p>
