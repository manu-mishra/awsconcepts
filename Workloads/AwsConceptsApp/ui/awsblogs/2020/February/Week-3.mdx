          <p>AWS Single Sign-On makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications. You can use AWS SSO to create and manage users centrally and grant access to AWS accounts and business applications, such as Databricks. Instead of having to sign in separately to Databricks Control Plane and other business applications, with this configuration enabled users can access Databricks with their corporate credentials using AWS SSO.</p>

          <p>Mainframe workloads are often tightly-coupled legacy monoliths with millions of lines of code, and customers want to modernize them for business agility. Manually rewriting a legacy application for a cloud-native architecture requires lots of re-engineering. See how AWS Blu Age transformed a typical mainframe CICS application to AWS containers and AWS Lambda functions. Youll also learn how to increase mainframe workload agility with refactoring to serverless and containers.</p>
