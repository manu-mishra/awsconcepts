          <p>Youve made the decision to migrate to the cloud and are ready to initiate the adoption process, but where do you begin?

          <p>In this post, we look at the new visualization features recently added to the Amazon Neptune workbench and released on August 12, 2020. These additional capabilities allow you to produce an interactive graph diagram representing the results of your Gremlin and SPARQL queries. We look at some Gremlin-specific features and then do the same for SPARQL. Finally, we look at some of the more advanced ways you can modify the visualizations. As a sidenote, this entire post was produced using the workbench.</p>

          <p>Inference is an important stage of machine learning pipelines that deliver insights to end users from trained neural network models. These models are deployed to perform predictive tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, constraints can make implementing inference at scale on edge devices such as IoT controllers and gateways challenging.

          <p>Data lakes can help hospitals and healthcare organizations turn data into insights and maintain business continuity, while preserving patient privacy. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions. In my previous post, Getting started with a healthcare data lake, I shared how to get started using data lakes in managing healthcare data and what a good first sprint architecture might look like. Here, I walk through building your first solution on AWS using a healthcare data lake as our example workload.</p>

          <p>Demand for housing continues to increase, with demand outweighing supply. Nonprofits, including social housing organizations, work towards the mission of providing access to safe and affordable housing, rental assistance, and social services to low-income individuals and families in need. These organizations also play a critical role in supporting the elderly and vulnerable. And with homelessness projected to increase by 40-45 percent this year in the United States, these services are more in demand than ever. The cloud can help nonprofits that serve those in need while also driving innovation, saving costs, and speeding delivery of services. Learn how these AWS customers and partners are modernizing the way that mission-driven organizations provide housing assistance.</p>

          <p>While disruptive events are challenging for any organization, sudden and large-scale incidents such as natural disasters, IT outages, pandemics, and cyber-attacks can expose critical gaps in technology, culture, and organizational resiliency. Even smaller, unexpected events such as water damage to a critical facility or electrical outages can negatively impact your organization if there is no long-term resiliency plan in place. These events can have significant consequences on your employees, stakeholders, and mission, and can result in long-term financial losses, lost productivity, loss of life, a deterioration of trust with citizens and customers, and lasting reputational damage.</p>

          <p>Due to COVID-19, schools quickly shifted to remote education to meet students needs and wrap up the school year. But with a new school year upon us and social distancing measures still in place, many classes will not gather in traditional classroom settings. Millions of students are now learning in their homes. And public sector leaders are creating new models to ensure learning is sustainable and accessible to all. These changes certainly carry their own set of challenges, but they also open new possibilities for the coming school year. Check out examples of how the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred important solutions to existing problems from primary school to higher education, and how the cloud has opened up new possibilities for educators and students as they start the new school year.</p>

          <p>Many SaaS organizations leverage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define a series of policies and roles that can be used to ensure tenants are not allowed to cross tenant boundaries when accessing resources.

Learn how dynamic policy generation creates a more scalable and manageable isolation experience.</p>

          <p>As schools return for their academic years amid a global pandemic, many questions persist around how best to enable both teachers and students to learn remotely, including accessing materials and applications in a secure and suitable form. Similarly, staff and administrators must have a reliable system for handling confidential information. For some, the answer is found in VPN connectivity and VDI. Streaming applications over the internet instead of having them physically installed on devices and desktops can save costs and address security concerns. InterVision, AWS Partner Network (APN) Partner, helped one of their higher education customers quickly and securely scale remote application delivery to students and faculty using Amazon AppStream 2.0, a solution that provides highly available remote user access while reducing the management time and costs compared to traditional solutions.</p>

          <p>Modern e-commerce websites face challenges in website versioning, system uptime, continuous deployments, and A/B testing. Migrating a full e-commerce solution is not a trivial project, and doing so while maintaining two versions of the website in production makes it more challenging on many levels. Leveraging AWS edge services, you can increase business agility by not only improving the migration experience, but also by employing A/B testing to validate business decisions faster.</p>

          <p>Quality, inclusive, and relevant education for all helps break the cycle of poverty and reduce inequalities worldwide. As education continues to shift to an online format, the potential for marginalized learners to fall behind is increasing due to the limited number of resources and tools available to help these students succeed. These four AWS EdStart companies from the United States, Brazil, China, and Europe are dedicated to equipping diverse students with tools that can aid them in their educational journey, no matter where they are learning.</p>

Altimeter is an open-source project (MIT License) from Tableau Software, LLC that scans AWS resources and links these resources into a graph. You can store, query, and visualize the data in Neptune. You can query the graph to examine the AWS resources and their relationships in an account. For example, you can query for resources or pathways that expose a cluster with a public IP address to check for security and compliance.</p>
