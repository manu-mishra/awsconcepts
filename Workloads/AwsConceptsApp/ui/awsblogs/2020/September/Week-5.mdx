          <p>Quality, inclusive, and relevant education for all helps break the cycle of poverty and reduce inequalities worldwide. As education continues to shift to an online format, the potential for marginalized learners to fall behind is increasing due to the limited number of resources and tools available to help these students succeed. These four AWS EdStart companies from the United States, Brazil, China, and Europe are dedicated to equipping diverse students with tools that can aid them in their educational journey, no matter where they are learning.</p>

          <p>In this post, we walk through an example we released for Neptune with integration with Altimeter. Altimeter is an open-source project (MIT License) from Tableau Software, LLC that scans AWS resources and links these resources into a graph. You can store, query, and visualize the data in Neptune. You can query the graph to examine the AWS resources and their relationships in an account. For example, you can query for resources or pathways that expose a cluster with a public IP address to check for security and compliance.</p>
