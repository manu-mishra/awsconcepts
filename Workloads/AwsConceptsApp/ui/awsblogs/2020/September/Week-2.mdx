          <p>The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is a federally funded research and development center sponsored by the National Science Foundation. It engages in large-scale Earth system science research projects in collaboration with the broader university community. NCAR hosts visitors from around the world, develops community models including the Community Earth System Model and the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, and maintains supercomputers, observational systems, and aircraft to support further study on the how the planet works. As part of theAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative, we invited Dr. David John Gagne, machine learning (ML) scientist at NCAR, to share how open data and machine learning on AWS are impacting the way we predict and understand extreme weather.</p>

          <p>Inference is an important stage of machine learning pipelines that deliver insights to end users from trained neural network models. These models are deployed to perform predictive tasks like image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, constraints can make implementing inference at scale on edge devices such as IoT controllers and gateways challenging. Learn how to train and convert a neural network model for image classification to an edge-optimized binary for Intel FPGA hardware.</p>

          <p>Data lakes can help hospitals and healthcare organizations turn data into insights and maintain business continuity, while preserving patient privacy. A data lake is a centralized, curated, and secured repository that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights and guide better business decisions. In my previous post, Getting started with a healthcare data lake, I shared how to get started using data lakes in managing healthcare data and what a good first sprint architecture might look like. Here, I walk through building your first solution on AWS using a healthcare data lake as our example workload.</p>

          <p>As screen time dependence has increased, education technology companies (EdTechs) are looking for new ways to engage students and create a more natural interaction with their products. One way to do so is using voice technology to help students, teachers, and administrators stay informed, be productive, and create more meaningful learning opportunities. To help, the AWS EdStart and Alexa in Education teams are launching the AWS EdStart Voice Builder course and badge. The AWS EdStart Member exclusive offering can help EdTechs build voice-first experiences that create fun and engaging learning experiences, reach new users, and save time by streamlining access to their products with Amazon Alexa.</p>

          <p>AWS App2Container (A2C) is an enabler for containerizing and migrating legacy applications to AWS quickly. Its value-add is specifically seen for use cases where the legacy system in question is large with heterogeneous applications, where A2C helps to bring a commonality to the migration approach, tools, and the target state architecture. With A2C, customers can quickly containerize their legacy applications and migrate to AWS with minimal remediation and at scale.</p>

          <p>Demand for housing continues to increase, with demand outweighing supply. Nonprofits, including social housing organizations, work towards the mission of providing access to safe and affordable housing, rental assistance, and social services to low-income individuals and families in need. These organizations also play a critical role in supporting the elderly and vulnerable. And with homelessness projected to increase by 40-45 percent this year in the United States, these services are more in demand than ever. The cloud can help nonprofits that serve those in need while also driving innovation, saving costs, and speeding delivery of services. Learn how these AWS customers and partners are modernizing the way that mission-driven organizations provide housing assistance.</p>
