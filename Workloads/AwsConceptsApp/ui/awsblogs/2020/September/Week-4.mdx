          <p>Transformation is a well-worn word these days. It means different things to different organizations. Frequently, transformation becomes about solving the most salient challenge facing the organization at that time and is often linked to a current pain point thats been difficult to solve.

          <p>In the world we live in today, companies need to quickly react to changeand to anticipate it. Customers tell us that their reliance on data has never been greater than what it is today.

          <p>Many organizations begin their cloud journey with a single AWS account and gradually expand their cloud presence into a multi-account environment for regulatory, compliance, security, or cost tracking purposes. Organizations often choose to deploy workloads and applications in multiple Regions on AWS Global Infrastructure for high availability, scalability, and performance.

          <p>Ahana is the startup that provides the first cloud-native managed service for Presto, the fast-growing, open source distributed SQL engine. Backed by GV (formerly known as Google Ventures) and Lux Ventures, the Ahana team includes experts in Presto, AWS, and big data. This blog post discusses how AWS users have evolved their big data requirements and how the team architected our managed service offering, highlighting the best practice of providing an In-VPC deployment. We hope other infrastructure software startups can benefit from sharing some of the key learnings that led to the launch of Ahana Cloud for Presto on AWS.</p>

          <p>Many SaaS organizations leverage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to define a series of policies and roles that can be used to ensure tenants are not allowed to cross tenant boundaries when accessing resources. To make this work, you have to create separate policies for each tenant which can create an explosion of tenant policies that push the account limits of IAM. Learn how dynamic policy generation creates a more scalable and manageable isolation experience.</p>

          <p>As schools return for their academic years amid a global pandemic, many questions persist around how best to enable both teachers and students to learn remotely, including accessing materials and applications in a secure and suitable form. Similarly, staff and administrators must have a reliable system for handling confidential information. For some, the answer is found in VPN connectivity and VDI. Streaming applications over the internet instead of having them physically installed on devices and desktops can save costs and address security concerns. InterVision, AWS Partner Network (APN) Partner, helped one of their higher education customers quickly and securely scale remote application delivery to students and faculty using Amazon AppStream 2.0, a solution that provides highly available remote user access while reducing the management time and costs compared to traditional solutions.</p>

Migrating a full e-commerce solution is not a trivial project, and doing so while maintaining two versions of the website in production makes it more challenging on many levels. Leveraging AWS edge services, you can increase business agility by not only improving the migration experience, but also by employing A/B testing to validate business decisions faster.</p>
