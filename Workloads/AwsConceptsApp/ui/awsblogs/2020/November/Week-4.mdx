          <p>Be it aspirin for headache, or statin for cholesterol, or amoxicillin as an antibiotic, there are small molecules that we refer to as drugs that can offer therapeutic remedy. Given the range of possible molecule to protein combinations, finding the right small molecule that is able to bind strongly to a certain target site and inhibit its function is a time-intensive and challenging feat. Enter VirtualFlow, a new open-source software that performs screens, essentially matchmaking between molecules and proteins. Harvard Medical School researchers developed the VirtualFlow platform that tests compounds through computer simulations. Using AWS and an AWS Cloud Credit for Research grant, the researchers demonstrated that VirtualFlow is able to run on the cloud.</p>

          <p>For more than a decade, customers have run their most strategic workloads on AWS, including SAP, VMware, and Windows, due to AWSs experience, maturity, reliability, security, and performance. While an increasing amount of customers are migrating their strategic workloads to AWS, the majority of businesses still run these critical workloads on-premises. AWS Partners serve as trusted advisors to many of these customers, supporting their migration and innovation journeys on the AWS Cloud.</p>
