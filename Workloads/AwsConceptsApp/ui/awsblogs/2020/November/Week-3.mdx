          <p>The shift from a traditional Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to microservices running on Kubernetes has given rise to a new set of challenges. To avoid blind spots, engineers need visibility into the dependencies between different microservices at the individual request level. Learn how Instana has fully automated the installation of the monitoring agent into Kubernetes, and how it helps monitor containerized workloads in Amazon EKS.</p>

          <p>With the launch of MongoDB 4.0 compatibility, Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) now supports performing transactions across multiple documents, statements, collections, and databases. Transactions simplify application development by enabling you to perform atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) operations across one or more documents within an Amazon DocumentDB cluster. Common use cases for transactions include financial processes, fulfilling and managing orders, and building multi-player games. In this post, I show you how to use transactions for common uses cases.</p>

          <p>Health information is generally disorganized, unstructured, and stored in various formats, making it impractical to trace patient history and promote the exchange of information on a national scale with other health professionals. A solution to this issue is the creation of a unique patient registry, which can be defined as a repository of retrospective, current, and prospective information of the patient in digital format. The main objective of this registry is to promote integrated, continuous, efficient, quality health care.In addition, the registry needs to be accessible and available to different health institutions.When building these registries, its necessary to use standards to define not only how the information is structured, but also how it can be retrieved and shared among the different HIS in a safe, scalable, cost-efficient way. This can be done using blockchain.</p>

          <p>If your data is stored in existing relational databases, converting relational data structures to documents can be complex and involve constructing and managing custom extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines. Amazon Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) can manage the migration process efficiently and repeatably. With AWS DMS, you can perform minimal downtime migrations, and can replicate ongoing changes to keep sources and targets in sync. This post provides an overview on how you can migrate your relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and others to Amazon DocumentDB using AWS DMS.</p>

          <p>To better support the growing use of cloud computing resources with increasing data- and compute-intensive research and education workloads, the National Science Foundations (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) announced the Cloud Access solicitation in September 2018. The NSF, through its competitive merit review process, selected CloudBank. Researchers that use CloudBank gain access to advanced hardware resources such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, and quantum processing units (QPUs). In addition, CloudBank offers proposal assistance, facilitated cloud access and account management, monitoring and resource usage optimization, andeliminates university overhead/indirect costs, and provides curated training materials, classroom, and help desk support.</p>

          <p>AWS IAM Identity Center helps administrators centrally manage access to multiple AWS accounts that are members of an AWS Organization. End users can authenticate and then access all their AWS accounts from a single interface. Using IAM Identity Center as a SAML identity provider for your AWS accounts also has security benefits: user credentials provided via federation are temporary. IAM Identity Center does not automatically detect AWS GovCloud (US) accounts associated with standard AWS accounts in your AWS Organization. IAM Identity Center is also not currently available in AWS GovCloud (US). As a result, IAM Identity Center cannot be used to automatically provision access for your users into an AWS GovCloud (US) account. However, this functionality can be extended to enable federation into AWS GovCloud (US) with a custom SAML 2.0 application in IAM Identity Center.</p>

          <p>Modern data engineering covers several key components of building a modern data lake. Most databases and data warehouses, to an extent, do not lend themselves well to a DevOps model. DataOps grew out of frustrations trying to build a scalable, reusable data pipeline in an automated fashion. DataOps was founded on applying DevOps principles on top of data lakes to help build automated solutions in a more agile manner. With DataOps, users apply principles of data processing on the data lake to curate and collect the transformed data for downstream processing. One reason that DevOps was hard on databases was because testing was hard to automate on such systems. At California State University Chancellors Office (CSUCO), we took a different approach by residing most of our logic with a programming framework that allows us to build a testable platform. Learn how to apply DataOps in ten steps.</p>

          <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is driving a parallel infodemic: the rapid spread of competing and often harmful narratives about the virus. Social media plays a central role in this infodemic, serving as a forum for the spread and evolution of theories and beliefs with origins in broadcast, print, online news, blogs, and other digital arenas. As the COVID-19 infodemic grew, Novetta used AWS to create Rapid Narrative Analysis (RNA), a solution that achieves accuracy by using human expertise at critical stages of analysis while using machine learning (ML) models to rapidly diagnose the severity of the spread of key narratives at a speed needed to take effective action.</p>

          <p>We have seen mainframe customers often encounter scalability constraints, and they cant support their development and test workforce to the scale required to support business requirements. These constraints can lead to delays, reduce product or feature releases, and make them unable to respond to market requirements. Furthermore, limits in capacity and scale often affect the quality of changes deployed, and are linked to unplanned or unexpected downtime in products or services.br /
The conventional approach to address these constraints is to scale up, meaning to increase MIPS/MSU capacity of the mainframe hardware available for development and testing. The cost of this approach, however, is excessively high, and to ensure time to market, you may reject this approach at the expense of quality and functionality. If youre wrestling with these challenges, this post is written specifically for you.</p>

          <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the globe in the initial months of 2020, colleges and universities saw their regular learning plans upended. In many instances, in only a week, higher education institutions reconfigured their pedagogical infrastructure for hundreds or thousands of students with widely varying requirements and learning environments. Given the circumstances and the tight timeframe, it was natural for many schools to rely on their existing learning management systems (LMS) in order to transition to fully online learning. Learn how Simpson College went several steps further, leveraging its Moodle LMS not only to provide its courses but also to fuel success for students and the institution, and set up a new way of operating beyond the pandemic. </p>

Whilst there are caveats of relying upon this approach, the cash comes with no equity dilution and can offer a pre-revenue lifeline. Here is what Settld has learnt from going through the process so far.</p>
