          <p>Historically, mainframes have hosted core-business processes, applications, and data, all of which are blocked in these rigid and expensive systems. AWS and Qlik can liberate mainframe data in real-time, enabling customers to exploit its full business value for data lakes, analytics, innovation, or modernization purposes. In this post, we describe how customers use Qlik Replicate real-time data streaming to put mainframe core-business data onto AWS.</p>

This makes it difficult for states to identify trends and emerging needs to respond and make data-driven decisions about the effective deployment of resources. The cloud can help bridge information silos. Read on for examples of how states use the cloud to bridge data silos and better serve the homeless.</p>

          <p>With Moovweb XDN and AWS, retailers can avoid costly slowdowns and maximize revenue potential during the holiday season. Once a product is requested, Moowebs CDN-as-JavaScript caches the JSON data at the edge, so it loads instantly. As visitor levels rise, so does cache hit rates for data at the edge, resulting in a faster experience. This enables ecommerce companies to deliver a lightning-fast experience that squeezes the maximum possible conversions out of every visit this holiday season.</p>

          <p>As you establish and implement your cost allocation model, AWS equips you with tools and resources to organize accounts and resources (e.g. AWS Organizations), improve visibility into detailed cost and usage data (e.g. AWS Cost and Usage Reports), and group cost and usage information into meaningful groups by your own rule (e.g. AWS Cost Categories). For customers who want to understand what premium 3rd party solutions are available to help you better organize and report your cost in preparation for chargeback or showback in your organizations, AWS Partner Network has verified partners that can offer cloud management solutions to help customers manage and optimize AWS environments.

They allow customers to build and run applications and services without dealing with infrastructure management tasks such as server or cluster provisioning, patching, operating system maintenance, and capacity provisioning. In this blog, I explain the serverless computing model, the Serverless Application Repository (SAR), solution constructs and implementations, why they matter to our government customers, and how they can use them to solve common problems.</p>
