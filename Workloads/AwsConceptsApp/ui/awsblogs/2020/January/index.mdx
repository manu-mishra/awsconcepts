          <p>Deep learning is inspired by the human brain and once a brain learns to identify an object, its identification becomes second nature. Similarly, as Deep Instincts artificial neural network learns to detect more and more types of cyber threats, its prediction capabilities become instinctive. As a result, malware both known and new can be predicted and prevented in zero-time. Deep Instincts predictive threat prevention platform can be applied against known or unknown threats, whether it be a file or fileless attack.</p>
