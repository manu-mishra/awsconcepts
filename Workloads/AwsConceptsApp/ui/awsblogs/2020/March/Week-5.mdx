          <p>Though containers vastly simplify the distribution of applications, Kubernetes ecosystems are so powerful that they, in turn, can become complex. This is particularly true in hybrid cloud environments. D2iQ Kommander simplifies Kubernetes container management, including governance, workload configuration, and life cycles. You can set up Kommander on Amazon EKS to manage your Kubernetes clusters across a broad range of cloud and on-premises environments.</p>

          <p>The worlds forests have decreased by nearly half since the onset of human civilization. Deforestation is continuing at a high rate due to agricultural pressure, poor land management, and climate change, which increases drought, disease, and invasive species. But a new generation of technologies is transforming our ability to manage and grow forests. The unprecedented level of data enables ecology-trained artificial intelligence (AI) to inventory the ecosystem and identify problems like plant condition stress, invasive weeds, species decline, and erosion. Learn how Dendra Systems is using the cloud to restore ecosystems around the world.</p>
