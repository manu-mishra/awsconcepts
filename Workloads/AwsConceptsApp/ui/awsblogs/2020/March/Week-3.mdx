          <p>In-memory data stores are widely used for application scalability, and developers have long appreciated their benefits for storing frequently accessed data, whether volatile or persistent.

Obviously, managing [...]</p>

          <p>Over two days, Steamhaus conducted an AWS Well-Architected Review on-site with the team who designed, built, and currently manage Elmer at Sperry Rail. Elmer uses machine intelligence to inspect thousands of miles of ultrasound scans collected by Sperrys inspection vehicles, searching for evidence of cracks in the rail. This partnership allowed quick improvements in efficiency, while ensuring the requirements of running the business day-to-day did not get in the way of improving Elmer.</p>

          <p>Every hour of every day, our nations first responders and 9-1-1 personnel rely on a patchwork of telecommunications and public safety applications to protect their residents and save lives. Whether its a 9-1-1 answering point, a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system, a records management (RMS) system, or a mobile communications network, emergency response systems must be available and operational at all times. The accepted availability standard for emergency response systems is 99.999% or five nines or about five minutes and 15 seconds of downtime per year.</p>
