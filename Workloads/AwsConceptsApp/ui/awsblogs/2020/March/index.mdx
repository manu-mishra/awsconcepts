          <p>In this blog post, we will show you how Amazon API Gateway can answer these questions as a component between your Amazon MSK cluster and your clients. Amazon MSK is a fully managed service for Apache Kafka that makes it easy to provision Kafka clusters with just a few clicks without the need to provision servers, manage storage, or configure Apache Zookeeper manually. Apache Kafka is an open-source platform for building real-time streaming data pipelines and applications.</p>

          <p>In this blog post, we describe a cloud native approach to demonstrate the power and capabilities of AWS. There are still good reasons for HANA System Replication (HSR) or third-party cluster software to build productive systems in cloud environments. However, we focus on an alternative approach by using cloud native features, such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) Snapshots. With these features we build an infrastructure with native backup/restore functionality, automated processes, and the focus of low costs, for non-critical SAP applications.</p>

          <p>Over two days, Steamhaus conducted an AWS Well-Architected Review on-site with the team who designed, built, and currently manage Elmer at Sperry Rail. Elmer uses machine intelligence to inspect thousands of miles of ultrasound scans collected by Sperrys inspection vehicles, searching for evidence of cracks in the rail. This partnership allowed quick improvements in efficiency, while ensuring the requirements of running the business day-to-day did not get in the way of improving Elmer.</p>

          <p>Over the past decade, a crop of new companies focused on Earth observation (EO) have made valuable EO data more accessible to a broad audience than before. As a result, we are seeing a dramatic increase in EO science. The value of EO data is the ability to monitor change. Recently, new instrumentation aboard satellites such as radar now allow us to see through clouds, allowing observation of any part of the Earth. The reliable, repeatable, and accurate data now flowing from satellites is opening up the reality of operational services powered by satellite imagery.

          <p>The worlds forests have decreased by nearly half since the onset of human civilization. Deforestation is continuing at a high rate due to agricultural pressure, poor land management, and climate change, which increases drought, disease, and invasive species. But a new generation of technologies is transforming our ability to manage and grow forests. The unprecedented level of data enables ecology-trained artificial intelligence (AI) to inventory the ecosystem and identify problems like plant condition stress, invasive weeds, species decline, and erosion. Learn how Dendra Systems is using the cloud to restore ecosystems around the world.</p>
