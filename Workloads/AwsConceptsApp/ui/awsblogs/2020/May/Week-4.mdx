          <p>As we continue to work with public sector bodies around the world, AWS understands how valuable open source software and development communities are at this time. To accelerate the combined global response to COVID-19, we gathered examples of third-party open code, tools, and standards that reformers in the public sector can immediately use. Weve included these in a new resource now available in Open Government Solutions.</p>

          <p>As larger and more complex workloads are deployed on AWS, multi-account solutions are an increasingly common architectural blueprint. Often referred to as cloud landing zones, these blueprints enable simple administrative boundaries. However, using multiple accounts increases the complexity of security tooling, access control and authorization, and cross-account networking. AWS Control Tower simplifies the process of setting up multi-account environments with predefined security baseline templates.</p>
