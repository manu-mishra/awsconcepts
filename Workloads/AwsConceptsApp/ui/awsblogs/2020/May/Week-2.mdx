          <p>Data scientists creating enterprise machine learning models to process large volumes of data spend a significant portion of their time managing the infrastructure required to process the data, rather than exploring the data and building ML models. You can reduce this overhead by running Qubole data processing tools and Amazon SageMaker. An open data lake platform, Qubole automates the administration and management of your resources on AWS.</p>

          <p>Customers want to use Teradata Vantage to analyze the data they have stored in Amazon S3, but the AWS service that prepares and loads data stored in S3 for analytics, AWS Glue, does not natively support Teradata Vantage. To use AWS Glue to prep and load data for analysis by Teradata Vantage, you need to rely on AWS Glue custom database connectors. Follow step-by-step instructions and learn how to set up Vantage and AWS Glue to perform Teradata-level analytics on the data you have stored in Amazon S3.</p>

          <p>To help APN Partners learn about running Microsoft workloads on AWS, we have designed a new series of Microsoft-focused virtual events. Each event consists of presentations and hands-on labs, executed in a small group setting of up to 15 attendees per session, and a maximum length of three hours. The sessions will enable you to build high-quality solutions, implement AWS best practices, and help customers run Microsoft workloads on the AWS.</p>

          <p>City and state government leaders are on the front line fighting COVID-19. Government agencies need to reach their constituents at a moments notice to communicate everything from the location of disease hot spots, calls for volunteers, providing life-saving guidelines, and keeping the public informed about the current state of affairs.

In this blog, you learn how to create an Amazon Connect instance, set it up in over a dozen languages, and send messages to millions of people in a short period of time.</p>
