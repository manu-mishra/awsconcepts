          <p>Schools are looking for ways to help their students remain productive and connected while learning remotely. End user computing (EUC) helps schools enable remote learning by providing every student access to the applications they need for class on any computer. This means bring the on-premises computer lab experience to the students, virtually. Amazon AppStream 2.0 can help educational institutions create virtual computer lab spaces at scale. AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed application streaming service that offers on-demand access to desktops and applications. Check out five things you should consider when rapidly deploying a virtual computer lab space using Amazon AppStream 2.0.</p>

          <p>Data scientists creating enterprise machine learning models to process large volumes of data spend a significant portion of their time managing the infrastructure required to process the data, rather than exploring the data and building ML models. You can reduce this overhead by running Qubole data processing tools and Amazon SageMaker. An open data lake platform, Qubole automates the administration and management of your resources on AWS.</p>

          <p>Customers want to use Teradata Vantage to analyze the data they have stored in Amazon S3, but the AWS service that prepares and loads data stored in S3 for analytics, AWS Glue, does not natively support Teradata Vantage. To use AWS Glue to prep and load data for analysis by Teradata Vantage, you need to rely on AWS Glue custom database connectors. Follow step-by-step instructions and learn how to set up Vantage and AWS Glue to perform Teradata-level analytics on the data you have stored in Amazon S3.</p>

Government agencies need to reach their constituents at a moments notice to communicate everything from the location of disease hot spots, calls for volunteers, providing life-saving guidelines, and keeping the public informed about the current state of affairs. They need to be able to reach citizens virtually or through electronic methods, since meeting in person isnt an option.

We describe how Glue ETL jobs can utilize the partitioning information available from AWS Glue Data Catalog to prune large datasets, manage large number of small files, and use JDBC optimizations for partitioned reads and batch record fetch from databases. You can use some or all of these techniques to help ensure your ETL jobs perform well.</p>

          <p>As larger and more complex workloads are deployed on AWS, multi-account solutions are an increasingly common architectural blueprint. Often referred to as cloud landing zones, these blueprints enable simple administrative boundaries. However, using multiple accounts increases the complexity of security tooling, access control and authorization, and cross-account networking. AWS Control Tower simplifies the process of setting up multi-account environments with predefined security baseline templates.</p>

Yet you may be unsure of how to get started and the impact of certain design decisions. To address the need to provide advice tailored to specific technology and application domains, AWS added the concept of well-architected lenses 2017. AWS now is happy to announce the Analytics Lens for the AWS Well-Architected Framework. This post provides an introduction of its purpose, topics covered, common scenarios, and services included.</p>
