          <p>As government agencies and public sector organizations modernize their IT and migrate to the AWS Cloud, the ability to gain a full, clear view of the security of their environments is a primary challenge they experience. This lack of visibility leads to blind spots and gaps in their security posture, leaving opportunity for security issues to arise. As a result, AWS developed a new open source Self-Service Security Assessment (with ransomware analysis modules) tool that provides customers with a point-in-time assessment to quickly gain valuable insights into the security posture of their AWS account.</p>

          <p>This is a guest post from Sammy Jordan, Assistant Treasurer at Contura Energy, in partnership with Emile Baizel, Sr. Blockchain Architect at AWS. In their own words, Contura Energy is a Tennessee-based coal supplier with affiliate mining operations across major coal basins in Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. We export metallurgical coal, a key raw material in steelmaking, to customers on five continents and approximately 25 countries. Contura chose to run the blockchain network on Amazon Managed Blockchain because its a fully managed service that scales automatically, as needed, and removes a lot of the heavy lifting needed to operate a blockchain network. Additionally, you can easily integrate Managed Blockchain with other AWS services, and Managed Blockchain simplifies growing and administering the blockchain network. Network governance and inviting new members can be done via the AWS Management Console, and each member is billed separately based on their own usage.</p>

          <p>Most organizations have to comply with regulations when dealing with their customer data. For that reason, datasets that contain personally identifiable information (PII) is often anonymized. A common example of PII can be tables and columns that contain personal information about an individual (such as first name and last name) or tables with columns that, if joined with another table, can trace back to an individual. You can use AWS Analytics services to anonymize your datasets. In this post, I describe how to use Amazon Athena to anonymize a dataset. You can then use AWS Lake Formation to provide the right access to the right personas.</p>

          <p>AWS is committed to helping our customers address the challenges brought about by COVID-19. In the months since the pandemic started, we have helped governments and organizations around the world accelerate efforts to track the virus, understand its outbreak, and better contain its spread. These are principles that have been reinforced by the World Health Organization (WHO). With the number of worldwide cases continuing to rise at an alarming rate, there is a global imperative to discover, test, and isolate patients in order to slow the viral spread, save lives, and fully reopen economies. To meet this public health imperative, governments are expanding their use of a well-established technique called contact tracing.</p>

When faced with a natural disaster, emergency, or cyberattack, these organizations need to continue running mission-critical applications to power essential platforms such as call centers, patient and judicial databases, and online learning sites. A disaster recovery (DR) strategy is necessary for public sector organizations that need to be there for their communities. CloudEndure Disaster Recovery, offered by AWS, can help organizations reduce DR total cost of ownership (TCO) and achieve business continuity.</p>

These tools are helping state, local, and federal governments respond quicker, and at the scale needed, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, one of the challenges governments face is finding out what open source tools are available. To help public sector customers use open source tools better, AWS launched Open Government Solutions, which aggregates open source projects and assets from public sector entities around the globe for governments at all levels to find, adapt, and reuse. During a panel conversation around the launch, government leaders outlined five key reasons why governments are choosing open source technologies to deliver citizen services.</p>

          <p>Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a fast, scalable, highly available, and fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads. You can use the same MongoDB 3.6 application code, drivers, and tools to run, manage, and scale workloads on Amazon DocumentDB without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. As a document database, Amazon DocumentDB makes it easy to store, query, and index JSON data. AWS built Amazon DocumentDB to uniquely solve your challenges around availability, performance, reliability, durability, scalability, backup, and more. In doing so, we built several tools, like the profiler, to help you run analyze your workload on Amazon DocumentDB. The profiler gives you the ability to log the time and details of slow-running operations on your cluster. In this post, we show you how to use the profiler in Amazon DocumentDB to analyze slow-running queries to identify bottlenecks and improve individual query performance and overall cluster performance.</p>

You can also configure Kinesis Data Firehose to transform the data before delivering it to its destination. You dont have to write applications and manage resources to read data and push to MongoDB. Its all managed by AWS, making it easier to estimate costs for your data based on your data volume. In this post, we discuss how to integrate Kinesis Data Firehose and MongoDB Cloud and demonstrate how to stream data from your source to MongoDB Atlas.</p>

To address the COVID-19 pandemic, public sector organizations are holding virtual hackathons to solve problems that arise from the virus and its effects on society. Hackathons #WirVsVirus in Germany, Hack the Crisis in Sweden, and #EUvsVirus brought together thousands of stakeholders to brainstorm and create innovative solutions using technology and cloud computing to address the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. Attendees at these virtual events worked to find solutions for problems like faster diagnosis of COVID-19 and connecting food with those in need. From technical mentorship to AWS Promotional Credit and providing access to technologies like AI, AWS supported these hackathons, their participants, and their solutions.</p>

          <p>This post demonstrates how to set up a blockchain application written in Java to read and write data to Managed Blockchain using the Fabric Java SDK. The Java SDK allows customers with applications written in Java to integrate blockchain support with their existing codebase. This makes it easier to handle rich data structures and complex business logic before writing records to the blockchain. You can also integrate Managed Blockchain using the Fabric Node.js SDK.

          <p>Ecree, an AWS EdStart Member, was founded by educators who believed the way we teach students to write is broken. The volume of work a teacher is being asked to do means students dont always get the necessary attention and feedback required to develop their writing skills. Ecrees founding team set out to support teachers and students by creating the worlds first rules-based tool that assesses student writing in the same way a highly trained professor does, on-demand. The solution uses cloud technologies including machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and voice technology to help improve student writing.</p>

          <p>Leveraging cloud-based microservices is not a solution that works for everyone or every application, but its one more point in favor of transitioning legacy applications to microservices. If youre already looking to re-architect, consider it an opportunity to spin out regulated data into separate containers. From there, its not much more effort to move those containers to AWS. Learn how AWS technologies can help organizations reduce their Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance burden.</p>

          <p>Many Windows solutions have used Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) as a method for performing ETL operations. Legacy SSIS packages that have been handed down to different developers over the years can be complex, cumbersome, and difficult to support. See an architecture and several techniques Cognizant uses to help clients with ETL operations based on legacy SSIS packaging move their applications to the AWS Cloud.</p>

          <p>Working with a network of 100 biodiversity information centers and 1,000 conservation scientists, NatureServe identifies and understands the most important places to prevent species extinction and ecosystem loss. They provide land use decision-makers in federal and state agencies, industry, academics, and nonprofits with information to meet both regulatory and biodiversity conservation needs. NatureServe and its network collect and maintain data on the conservation status and location of threatened and endangered species, developed over decades of field data collection. But these data have been underutilized in environmental review decision-making processes due to challenges surrounding awareness, access, and reliable or seamless integration with other systems. To address these challenges, they developed an online spatially explicit tool on AWS.</p>
