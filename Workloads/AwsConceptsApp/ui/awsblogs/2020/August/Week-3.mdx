          <p>As you design, develop, and build SaaS solutions on AWS, you must think about how you want to partition the data that belongs to each of your customers (tenants). In this post, experts from AWS SaaS Factory focus on what it means to implement the pooled model with Amazon DynamoDB. Well outline basic strategies to partition and isolate data by tenant, and illustrate common techniques you can use to avoid the hot partition problem thats often associated with partitioning tenant data in a pooled model.</p>

          <p>Cost conscious credit unions looking to provide digital banking services need logical isolation from other tenants. Larger credit unions, on the other hand, require physical as well as logical isolation from other tenants. Persistent Systems Digital Credit Union Solution helps a credit union go live in a short time frame with digital banking offerings such as digital loans or digital deposits. The solution uses fine-grained microservices, deployed on Amazon EKS and provided as secure APIs using Amazon API Gateway.</p>

          <p>Oracle customers have common questions about their licensing options when considering deployment to AWS. Oracle customers who do not proactively confirm their options risk spending too much on licensing. Customers may also face an Oracle audit that could expose avoidable license compliance issues. AWS has a variety of options for customers considering deployment of Oracle to AWS. When done properly, customers can significantly optimize their Oracle license costs when deploying to the proper AWS service.</p>

          <p>Governments are sharing their technology solutions with other governments through open source tools. These tools are helping state, local, and federal governments respond quicker, and at the scale needed, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, one of the challenges governments face is finding out what open source tools are available. To help public sector customers use open source tools better, AWS launched Open Government Solutions, which aggregates open source projects and assets from public sector entities around the globe for governments at all levels to find, adapt, and reuse. During a panel conversation around the launch, government leaders outlined five key reasons why governments are choosing open source technologies to deliver citizen services.</p>

          <p>Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) is a fast, scalable, highly available, and fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads. You can use the same MongoDB 3.6 application code, drivers, and tools to run, manage, and scale workloads on Amazon DocumentDB without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. As a document database, Amazon DocumentDB makes it easy to store, query, and index JSON data. AWS built Amazon DocumentDB to uniquely solve your challenges around availability, performance, reliability, durability, scalability, backup, and more. In doing so, we built several tools, like the profiler, to help you run analyze your workload on Amazon DocumentDB. The profiler gives you the ability to log the time and details of slow-running operations on your cluster. In this post, we show you how to use the profiler in Amazon DocumentDB to analyze slow-running queries to identify bottlenecks and improve individual query performance and overall cluster performance.</p>

          <p>Application workloads being built for the cloud are getting easier to deploy with tools like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate), infrastructure as code (IaC), and full-scale DevSecOps pipelines. But theres more to migrating workloads than ease of development and deployment: application workloads still need [...]</p>

          <p>Development teams are running manual and automated tests several times a day for their feature branches. Running tests locally is only one part of the process. To test workloads against other systems as well as give access to QA engineers, it requires deploying code to dedicated environments. These servers/VMs spend hours idling because new test [...]</p>

          <p>Development teams use agile development processes based on Git services extensively. AWS provides AWS CodeCommit, a managed, Git protocol-based, secure, and highly available code service. The capabilities of CodeCommit combined with other developer tools, like AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline, make it easy to manage collaborative, scalable development process with fine-grained permissions and on-demand resources.</p>
