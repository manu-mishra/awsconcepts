          <p>As government agencies and public sector organizations modernize their IT and migrate to the AWS Cloud, the ability to gain a full, clear view of the security of their environments is a primary challenge they experience. This lack of visibility leads to blind spots and gaps in their security posture, leaving opportunity for security issues to arise. As a result, AWS developed a new open source Self-Service Security Assessment (with ransomware analysis modules) tool that provides customers with a point-in-time assessment to quickly gain valuable insights into the security posture of their AWS account.</p>

          <p>This is a guest post from Sammy Jordan, Assistant Treasurer at Contura Energy, in partnership with Emile Baizel, Sr. Blockchain Architect at AWS. In their own words, Contura Energy is a Tennessee-based coal supplier with affiliate mining operations across major coal basins in Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. We export metallurgical coal, a key raw material in steelmaking, to customers on five continents and approximately 25 countries. Contura chose to run the blockchain network on Amazon Managed Blockchain because its a fully managed service that scales automatically, as needed, and removes a lot of the heavy lifting needed to operate a blockchain network. Additionally, you can easily integrate Managed Blockchain with other AWS services, and Managed Blockchain simplifies growing and administering the blockchain network. Network governance and inviting new members can be done via the AWS Management Console, and each member is billed separately based on their own usage.</p>

          <p>Most organizations have to comply with regulations when dealing with their customer data. For that reason, datasets that contain personally identifiable information (PII) is often anonymized. A common example of PII can be tables and columns that contain personal information about an individual (such as first name and last name) or tables with columns that, if joined with another table, can trace back to an individual. You can use AWS Analytics services to anonymize your datasets. In this post, I describe how to use Amazon Athena to anonymize a dataset. You can then use AWS Lake Formation to provide the right access to the right personas.</p>

          <p>AWS is committed to helping our customers address the challenges brought about by COVID-19. In the months since the pandemic started, we have helped governments and organizations around the world accelerate efforts to track the virus, understand its outbreak, and better contain its spread. These are principles that have been reinforced by the World Health Organization (WHO). With the number of worldwide cases continuing to rise at an alarming rate, there is a global imperative to discover, test, and isolate patients in order to slow the viral spread, save lives, and fully reopen economies. To meet this public health imperative, governments are expanding their use of a well-established technique called contact tracing.</p>

When faced with a natural disaster, emergency, or cyberattack, these organizations need to continue running mission-critical applications to power essential platforms such as call centers, patient and judicial databases, and online learning sites. A disaster recovery (DR) strategy is necessary for public sector organizations that need to be there for their communities. CloudEndure Disaster Recovery, offered by AWS, can help organizations reduce DR total cost of ownership (TCO) and achieve business continuity.</p>
