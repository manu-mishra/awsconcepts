          <p>Containers are rapidly maturing within the high performance computing (HPC) community and were excited to be part of the movement: listening to what customers have to say and feeding this back to both the communityandour own product and service teams. Containerization has the potential tounblockHPC environments, so AWS ParallelCluster and container-native schedulers like AWS Batch are moving quickly to reflect the best practices developed by the community and our customers. This year is the seventh consecutive year we are hosting the High Performance Container Workshop at ISC High Performance 2021 conference (ISC21). The workshop will be taking place on July 2nd at 2PM CEST (7AM CST). The full program for the workshop is available on the High Performance Container Workshop page at https://hpcw.github.io/</p>

          <p>About 40 million MRI scans are performed in the United States every year. MRIs are a valuable part of diagnostic plans, but as they exist today, they may not always be a part of a patients care plan. A research team at the New York University (NYU) Langone Center set out to make MRIs more accessible for more patients by using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and the power of cooperative open data sharing.</p>

          <p>AWS cloud usage data is a critical component in the IT Financial Management process for AWS customers. As organizations grow in cloud maturity, the cloud usage data may become complex as usage incurs from distributed teams and businesses. Financial and Technology leaders need access to trends, signals, insights, and cost deviations to quickly understand and analyze the cloud usage. The AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) provide comprehensive data about your AWS costs, including information related to product, pricing, and usage. By including the Resource IDs and choosing hourly time granularity, CUR allows you to analyze your costs in greater detail and accuracy. You can download the CUR reports from the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) console, query the reports using Amazon Athena or load the reports into Amazon Redshift or visualize in Amazon QuickSight.</p>

          <p>The Global Data Egress Waiver (GDEW) program helps eligible researchers and academic institutions use AWS cloud storage, computing, and database services by waiving data egress fees. GDEW can be a valuable tool that gives eligible researchers and institutions a more predictable budget, which in turns allows them to have more direct access to the cloud than they might otherwise. Find out if your team is eligible to take advantage of the data egress waiver program.</p>

          <p>Take a Well-Architected approach to make an informed decision when choosing to implement CI/CD using open-source tools on AWS services, using managed AWS services, or a combination of both.
We will look at key considerations for evaluating open-source software and AWS Services using the perspectives of a startup company, and a mature company, as examples. These will give you two very different points of view that you can use to compare to your own organization. To make this investigation easier we will use Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) capabilities as the target of our investigation.
In our next two blog posts we will follow two AWS customers Iponweb and BigHat Biosciences as they share their CI/CD journeys, their perspective, the decisions they made, and why.
To end the series, we will explore an example reference architecture showing the benefits AWS provides regardless of your emphasis on open source tools or managed AWS services.</p>
