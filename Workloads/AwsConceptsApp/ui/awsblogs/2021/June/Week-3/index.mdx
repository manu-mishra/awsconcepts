          <p>Customers operating in hybrid environments today face tremendous challenges with regard to operational management, security/compliance, and monitoring. Systems administrators have to connect, monitor, patch, and automate across multiple Operating Systems (OS), applications, cloud, and on-premises infrastructure. Each of these scenarios has its own unique vendor and console purpose-built for a specific use case. Using Hybrid [...]</p>

          <p>Containers are rapidly maturing within the high performance computing (HPC) community and we’re excited to be part of the movement: listening to what customers have to say and feeding this back to both the community and our own product and service teams. Containerization has the potential to unblock HPC environments, so AWS ParallelCluster and container-native schedulers like AWS Batch are moving quickly to reflect the best practices developed by the community and our customers. This year is the seventh consecutive year we are hosting the ‘High Performance Container Workshop’ at ISC High Performance 2021 conference (ISC’21). The workshop will be taking place on July 2nd at 2PM CEST (7AM CST). The full program for the workshop is available on the High Performance Container Workshop page at https://hpcw.github.io/</p>
