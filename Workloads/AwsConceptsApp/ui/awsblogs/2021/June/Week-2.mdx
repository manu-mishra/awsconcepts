          <p>AWS cloud usage data is a critical component in the IT Financial Management process for AWS customers. As organizations grow in cloud maturity, the cloud usage data may become complex as usage incurs from distributed teams and businesses. Financial and Technology leaders need access to trends, signals, insights, and cost deviations to quickly understand and analyze the cloud usage. The AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) provide comprehensive data about your AWS costs, including information related to product, pricing, and usage. By including the Resource IDs and choosing hourly time granularity, CUR allows you to analyze your costs in greater detail and accuracy. You can download the CUR reports from the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) console, query the reports using Amazon Athena or load the reports into Amazon Redshift or visualize in Amazon QuickSight.</p>

          <p>The Global Data Egress Waiver (GDEW) program helps eligible researchers and academic institutions use AWS cloud storage, computing, and database services by waiving data egress fees. GDEW can be a valuable tool that gives eligible researchers and institutions a more predictable budget, which in turns allows them to have more direct access to the cloud than they might otherwise. Find out if your team is eligible to take advantage of the data egress waiver program.</p>

          <p>Take a Well-Architected approach to make an informed decision when choosing to implement CI/CD using open-source tools on AWS services, using managed AWS services, or a combination of both.
We will look at key considerations for evaluating open-source software and AWS Services using the perspectives of a startup company, and a mature company, as examples. These will give you two very different points of view that you can use to compare to your own organization. To make this investigation easier we will use Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) capabilities as the target of our investigation.
In our next two blog posts we will follow two AWS customers Iponweb and BigHat Biosciences as they share their CI/CD journeys, their perspective, the decisions they made, and why.
To end the series, we will explore an example reference architecture showing the benefits AWS provides regardless of your emphasis on open source tools or managed AWS services.</p>

          <p>Organizations today want to make data-driven decisions. The data could lie in multiple source systems, such as line of business applications, log files, connected devices, social media, and many more. As organizations adopt software as a service (SaaS) applications, data becomes increasingly fragmented and trapped in different data islands. To make decision-making easier, organizations are [...]</p>
