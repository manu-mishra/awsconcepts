          <p>Much as microchips did through the 1980s and 90s, batteries are now finding their way into many devices and systems around us, and in the process are changing what we previously thought possible. Advances in lithium-ion battery technology in particular have enabled transformations in the way we connect and find information, the way we move people and goods, and the way we power our homes and buildings. The transition to a battery-powered world is not without its challenges, however. While mature technologies like the mechanical components (springs, hinges, enclosures) and semiconductors that make up most of our devices are well understood and tend to fail in predictable ways, batteries are much more complicated. Read on to learn how Voltaiq works with a global customer base, including Lab126, to help them to launch products faster, optimize performance and reliability, and minimize risks from warranty returns and recalls.</p>
