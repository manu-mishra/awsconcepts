          <p>Hyperledger Fabric is a top blockchain protocol choice for enterprise use cases that require a permissioned blockchain network. Fabric supports the full spectrum of levels of decentralization, so its no surprise that multiple blockchain-as-a-service platforms exist that support Fabric. However, most of these platforms target the fully decentralized governance model, with all members being equal. Learn how Kaleido makes provisioning a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network dramatically simpler.</p>

Trees provide significant benefits against heat related illnesses and climate change, and trees can help advance social equity when they are planted in the neighborhoods that need them the most. But the challenge of achieving Tree Equity across the country is immense. To address this, American Forests is leading a new national campaign through the Tree Equity Score, powered by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.</p>

          <p>To meet the challenge of simplifying data protection for hybrid environments, Cohesity introduced Data Management as a Service (DMaaS), powered by AWS. Cohesitys DMaaS portfolio encompasses multiple as-a-service offerings, including Backup-as-a-Service (BaaS) which is available in AWS Marketplace as Cohesity DataProtect. The service is presented via Cohesitys globally available web interface, so for protecting workloads not running in AWS customers do not even need to have an AWS account.</p>

          <p>Much as microchips did through the 1980s and 90s, batteries are now finding their way into many devices and systems around us, and in the process are changing what we previously thought possible. Advances in lithium-ion battery technology in particular have enabled transformations in the way we connect and find information, the way we move people and goods, and the way we power our homes and buildings. The transition to a battery-powered world is not without its challenges, however. While mature technologies like the mechanical components (springs, hinges, enclosures) and semiconductors that make up most of our devices are well understood and tend to fail in predictable ways, batteries are much more complicated. Read on to learn how Voltaiq works with a global customer base, including Lab126, to help them to launch products faster, optimize performance and reliability, and minimize risks from warranty returns and recalls.</p>
