          <p>Even before the pandemic, many people were rent burdened, with aquarter of renters paying more than half their income on rent. US Congress approved two bills containing $45 billion for emergency rental assistance programs (ERAP) that states and local governments can use to support people in need. Distributing these funds quickly and efficiently requires local agencies to rapidly design and deploy new engagement models, programs, and workflows that are easy to use, that can quickly scale up to meet demand, and are flexible enough to adjust to changes in federal and local requirements. Learn how these AWS customers and partners are leveraging the cloud to quickly launch and distribute benefit assistance programs like emergency rental assistance.</p>

          <p>One of the first steps for organizations adopting AWS is migrating data from an on-premises environment or existing cloud to AWS. Many legal and regulatory requirements make it imperative to know the cause and reason for collection, storage, and usage of data, as well as the exact physical location of the data. Learn how Dataguise, a PKWARE company, helps organizations minimize risk and cost during the data migration process.</p>
