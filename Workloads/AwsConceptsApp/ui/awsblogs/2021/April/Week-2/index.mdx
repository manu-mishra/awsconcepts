          <p>AWS RoboMaker released a tool configuration feature that allows customers to improve control of diagnostic tools with their simulations. This new level of control allows users to configure which default tools to run, change the commands used to run them, and add additional tools. In this blog, we walk through two procedures. First, we walk through how to add a configuration to an existing tool and, second, how to add a new tool to your simulation.</p>

Using data for statistics initiatives, including open data, can help researchers produce innovative products and tools, including visualisation, to inform government officials ahead of making policy decisions that impact their citizens. When it comes to big data, policy makers need to collaborate with researchers to address issues and challenges in using these new data sources. To work toward this goal, Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, hosted its bi-annual European Big Data Hackathon.</p>

          <p>One of the biggest scientific achievements of the twenty-first&#160;century was the completion of the Human Genome Project and the publication of a draft human genome. The project took over 13 years to complete and remains one of the largest private-public international collaborations ever. Advances since in sequencing technologies, computational hardware, and novel algorithms reduced the time it takes to produce a human genome assembly to only a few days, at a fraction of the cost. This made using the human genome draft for precision and personalized medicine more achievable. In this blog, we demonstrate how to do a genome assembly in the cloud in a cost-efficient manner using ARM-based AWS Graviton2 instances.</p>
