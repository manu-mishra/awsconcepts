          <p>The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is responsible for the CIS Controls and CIS Benchmarks, which are globally recognized best practices for securing IT systems and data. The implementation of these can help harden systems through various means, whether it be disabling unnecessary ports or eliminating unneeded services. Purchasing a pre-hardened image is a great option, especially since you are ensured compliance with the CIS Benchmark, and deploying it would not require much maintenance on your end.</p>

          <p>AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is a highly automated lift-and-shift solution, which works by replicating your on-premises (physical or virtual) and/or cloud servers into your AWS account. When you’re ready, AWS MGN automatically converts and launches your servers on AWS so you can quickly benefit from the cost savings, productivity, resilience, and agility of the cloud. This guide teaches you how to migrate a content management system platform (CMS), based on an example with WordPress, running on a simulated on-premises environment to AWS Cloud, using MGN.</p>

I explain some of the benefits of streaming architectures and how Kinesis works with producers and consumers. I compare different ways to ingest data, how streams are composed of shards, and how partition keys determine which shard is used. Finally, I explain the payload formats at the different stages of a streaming workload, how message ordering works with shards, and why idempotency is important to handle.</p>
