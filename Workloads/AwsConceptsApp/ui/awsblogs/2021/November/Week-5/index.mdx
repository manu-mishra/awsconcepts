          <p>Singapore&#8217;s national space office, the Office for Space Technology and Industry (OSTIn), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) today announced they have signed a Statement of Strategic Intent and Cooperation. This Statement is the first of its kind for AWS in Asia, and will help support Singapore&#8217;s focus on space as a potential new industry for economic growth and technology development. The Statement between AWS and OSTIn outlines specific areas of collaboration designed to foster the development of space technologies and support the creation of a vibrant, sustainable, and innovative space hub in Singapore.</p>

          <p>With so many options to browse and discover products, consumers don&#8217;t shop linearly.

          <p>Food waste is a global issue that stretches far beyond its impact on underfed populations: it&#8217;s one of the primary drivers behind the climate crisis, representing 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Combating food waste reduces methane emissions in particular, while also preventing the waste of the labor and resources required to make the food.
