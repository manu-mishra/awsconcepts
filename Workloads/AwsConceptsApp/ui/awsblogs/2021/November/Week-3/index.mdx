          <p>This year, weve launched a lot of new capabilities for HPC customers, making AWS the best place for the length and breadth of their workflows. EFA went mainstream and is now available in sixteen instance families for fast fabric capabilities for scaling MPI and NCCL codes. Weve written deep-dive studies to explore and explain the optimizations that will drive your workloads faster in the cloud than elsewhere. We released a major new version of AWS ParallelCluster with its own API for controlling the cluster lifecycle. AWS Batch became deeply integrated into AWS Step Functions and now supports fair-share scheduling, with multiple levers to control the experience. Today were signaling the arrival of a new HPC-dedicated instance family the Hpc6a and an enhanced EnginFrame that will bring the best of the cloud and on-premises together in a single interface.</p>

          <p>As the real-world changes, machine learning models degrade in their ability to accurately represent it, resulting in model performance degradation. Thats why its important for data scientists and machine learning engineers to support models with tools that provide ML monitoring and observability, thereby preventing that performance degradation. In this post, we dive into the WhyLabs AI Observatory, a data and ML monitoring and observability platform, and show how it complements Amazon SageMaker.</p>

Depending on their experience and sophistication, the CLI can be a daunting experience for users not accustomed in using it. Fortunately, the cloud offers many other options for users to submit and manage their computational jobs. In this blog post we will cover how to create a serverless API to interact with an HPC system in the the cloud built with AWS ParallelCluster.</p>
