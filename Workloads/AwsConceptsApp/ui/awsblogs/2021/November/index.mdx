But the story of how we got there involves our Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), some difficult problems presented to us by customers in the entertainment industry, and an invention called the Cloud Digital Interface (CDI).

          <p>OMass Therapeutics, a biotechnology company identifying medicines against highly validated target ecosystems, used Yellowdog on AWS to analyze and screen 337 million compounds in 7 hours, a task which would have taken two months using an on-premises HPC cluster. YellowDog, based in Bristol in the UK, ran the drug discovery application on an extremely large, multi-region cluster in AWS with the AWS pay-as-you-go pricing model. It provided a central, unified interface to monitor and manage AWS Region selection, compute provisioning, job allocation and execution. The entire workload completed in 65 minutes, enabling scientists to start work on analysis the same day, significantly accelerating the drug discovery process. In this post, well discuss the AWS and YellowDog services we deployed, and the mechanisms used to scale to 3.2m vCPUs using multiple EC2 instance types across multiple regions in 33 minutes, running at a 95% utilization rate.</p>

          <p>This year, weve launched a lot of new capabilities for HPC customers, making AWS the best place for the length and breadth of their workflows. EFA went mainstream and is now available in sixteen instance families for fast fabric capabilities for scaling MPI and NCCL codes. Weve written deep-dive studies to explore and explain the optimizations that will drive your workloads faster in the cloud than elsewhere. We released a major new version of AWS ParallelCluster with its own API for controlling the cluster lifecycle. AWS Batch became deeply integrated into AWS Step Functions and now supports fair-share scheduling, with multiple levers to control the experience. Today were signaling the arrival of a new HPC-dedicated instance family the Hpc6a and an enhanced EnginFrame that will bring the best of the cloud and on-premises together in a single interface.</p>

Thats why its important for data scientists and machine learning engineers to support models with tools that provide ML monitoring and observability, thereby preventing that performance degradation. In this post, we dive into the WhyLabs AI Observatory, a data and ML monitoring and observability platform, and show how it complements Amazon SageMaker.</p>

Depending on their experience and sophistication, the CLI can be a daunting experience for users not accustomed in using it. Fortunately, the cloud offers many other options for users to submit and manage their computational jobs. In this blog post we will cover how to create a serverless API to interact with an HPC system in the the cloud built with AWS ParallelCluster.</p>

          <p>By avoiding inspections, insurers lose the opportunity to adequately consider all factors during underwriting and take on more risk. TCS has built a virtual inspection solution on AWS that is customizable to various inspection use cases, such as home insurance inspections and claims, auto claims damage assessment and estimation, and mortgage inspection. This post provides an overview of the TCS virtual inspection solution, describes the high-level architecture, and explores the potential business benefits for insurers.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, Amazon pledged to hire 100,000 veterans and military spouses by 2024. This is an increase of our previous commitment to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses by 2021a goal weve already surpassed, with about 40,000 currently working for Amazon. At AWS, we are committed to developing and hiring veterans and their spouses into roles focused on STEM. Check out the multiple programs, trainings, and resources available for veterans and spouses.</p>

          <p>While several public sector organizations launched new digital services during the pandemic, many still struggle with providing a high quality and equitable customer experience. To reduce the risk of a digital service not being received, or only being used by a limited portion of the intended population, government leaders should ask three customer experience questions before deploying new services and consider how the cloud can help shape the answers.</p>

          <p>Today we are announcing fair-share scheduling (FSS) for AWS Batch, which provides fine-grain control of the scheduling behavior by using a scheduling policy. With FSS, customers can prevent unfair situations caused by strict first-in, first-out scheduling where high priority jobs cant jump the queue without draining other jobs first. You can now balance resource consumption between groups of workloads and have confidence that the shared compute environment is not dominated by a single workload. In this post, well explain how fair-share scheduling works in more detail. Youll also find a link to a step-by-step workshop at the end of this post, so you can try it out yourself.</p>

          <p>The biggest challenge for new startups is to get to market as quickly as possible before the money runs out and prove that your company is set to take over the market. To accelerate time to market, you need a minimum viable product (MVP), or the smallest and quickest functional version of your idea. Its something that can be tested quickly and easily, shipped and iterated as often as necessary, as feedback comes back. It proves not only that your new idea works, but that you have the ability to produce it, and the proof that your audience wants it. In this upcoming live webinar, learn how to successfully develop an MVP with AWS and propel your company on the path to success.</p>

          <p>Many shared file systems are used in supporting read-intensive applications, like financial backtesting. These applications typically exploit copies of datasets whose authoritative copy resides somewhere else. For small datasets, in-memory databases and caching techniques can yield impressive results. However, low latency flash-based scalable shared file systems can provide both massive IOPs and bandwidth. Theyre also easy to adopt because of their use of a file-level abstraction. In this post, Ill share how to easily create and scale a shared, distributed POSIX compatible file system that performs at local NVMe speeds for files opened read-only.</p>

          <p>Several smart cities use FIWARE, an open source framework supporting the development of smart solutions. FIWARE leverages sensing data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices, then collects, stores, and analyzes data with an API call. One FIWARE component, Orion Context Broker, gathers context information from diverse sources such as mobile apps, IoT devices, and social networking services, and manages the lifecycle of this context information, from registrations, updates, queries, and subscriptions. In this blog post, we address building Orion Context Broker on AWS. Learn how to deploy Orion Context Broker and Cygnus on AWS with AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) and Docker Compose quickly.</p>

          <p>Industrial organizations rely on high-value (core) machinery such as processing plant crushers and conveyors for their factory operations. In these same factories, there are secondary (non-core) assets such as motors, pumps, and generators located on the periphery of customer sites, but many are physically isolated, disconnected, and legacy in nature. Urban.ios Asset Monitoring Data Subscription solution removes the technical challenges typically required to connect these hard-to-reach assets within factories.</p>

          <p>This post shows how to create a Step Functions workflow for Forecast using AWS SDK service integrations, which allows you to use over 200 with AWS API actions. It shows two patterns for handling asynchronous tasks. The first pattern queries the describe-* API repeatedly and the second pattern uses the Retry option. This simplifies the development of workflows because in many cases they can replace Lambda functions.</p>
