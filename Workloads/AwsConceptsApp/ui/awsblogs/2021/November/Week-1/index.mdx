          <p>The biggest challenge for new startups is to get to market as quickly as possible before the money runs out &#8212; and prove that your company is set to take over the market. To accelerate time to market, you need a minimum viable product (MVP), or the smallest and quickest functional version of your idea. It&#8217;s something that can be tested quickly and easily, shipped and iterated as often as necessary, as feedback comes back. It proves not only that your new idea works, but that you have the ability to produce it, and the proof that your audience wants it. In this upcoming live webinar, learn how to successfully develop an MVP with AWS and propel your company on the path to success.</p>

          <p>Many shared file systems are used in supporting read-intensive applications, like financial backtesting. These applications typically exploit copies of datasets whose authoritative copy resides somewhere else. For small datasets, in-memory databases and caching techniques can yield impressive results. However, low latency flash-based scalable shared file systems can provide both massive IOPs and bandwidth. They&#8217;re also easy to adopt because of their use of a file-level abstraction. In this post, I&#8217;ll share how to easily create and scale a shared, distributed POSIX compatible file system that performs at local NVMe speeds for files opened read-only.</p>

          <p>Startup management often grapple with defining and outlining an AWS Admin&#8217;s responsibilities. With these resources, founders and stakeholders can hire and develop the best, while maintaining an appropriate level of separation of duties that often plague a startup&#8217;s growth and scalability. By following the practices defined here, AWS Admins can balance performing day-to-day activities effectively, help their startups adopt good security hygiene practices often required as part of third-party assurance, and optimize infrastructure costs.</p>

          <p>Industrial organizations rely on high-value (core) machinery such as processing plant crushers and conveyors for their factory operations. In these same factories, there are secondary (non-core) assets such as motors, pumps, and generators located on the periphery of customer sites, but many are physically isolated, disconnected, and legacy in nature. Urban.io&#8217;s Asset Monitoring Data Subscription solution removes the technical challenges typically required to connect these hard-to-reach assets within factories.</p>

          <p>This post shows how to create a Step Functions workflow for Forecast using AWS SDK service integrations, which allows you to use over 200 with AWS API actions. It shows two patterns for handling asynchronous tasks. The first pattern queries the describe-* API repeatedly and the second pattern uses the &#8220;Retry&#8221; option. This simplifies the development of workflows because in many cases they can replace Lambda functions.</p>
