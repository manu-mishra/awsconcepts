          <p>Increasingly, a businesss success depends on its agility in transforming data into actionable insights, which requires efficient and automated data processes. In the previous post Build a SQL-based ETL pipeline with Apache Spark on Amazon EKS, we described a common productivity issue in a modern data architecture. To address the challenge, we demonstrated how to utilize a declarative approach as the key enabler to improve efficiency, which resulted in a faster time to value for businesses. Generally speaking, managing applications declaratively in Kubernetes is a widely adopted best practice. You can use the same approach to build and deploy Spark applications with open-source or in-house build frameworks to achieve the same productivity goal.</p>

          <p>Microservices commonly communicate with JSON over HTTP/1.1. These technologies are ubiquitous and human-readable, but they arent optimized for communication between dozens or hundreds of microservices. Next-generation Web technologies, including gRPC and HTTP/2, significantly improve communication speed and efficiency between microservices. AWS offers the most complete platform for builders implementing microservices and the addition of HTTP/2 and gRPC support in Application Load Balancer (ALB) provides an end-to-end solution for next-generation microservices. ALBs can inspect and route gRPC calls, enabling features like health checks, access logs, and gRPC-specific metrics. This post demonstrates .NET microservices communicating with gRPC via Application Load Balancers.</p>

Its the sweet spot between too much (compute) and too little (+risk), plus it protects against root account compromise in a public cloud.</p>

          <p>Weather radars see more than just the weather: they see smoke from fires, meteors, birds, mayflies, and almost anything else in the atmosphere. This makes weather radars an invaluable tool for scientists seeking to further the understanding of atmospheric processes and anything else that happens to be flying through the radars field of view. The Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) seeks to accelerate sustainability-related innovation and research by helping to minimizing the cost and time required to store, acquire, and analyze large weather and climate datasets.</p>

          <p>Seismic imaging is the process of positioning the Earths subsurface reflectors. It transforms the seismic data recorded in time at the Earths surface to an image of the Earths subsurface. This is done by back-propagating data from time to space in a given velocity model. Kirchhoff depth migration is a well-known technique used in geophysics for seismic imaging. Kirchhoff time and depth migration produce an image with higher resolution and generate an image of the subsurface for a subset class of the data, providing valuable information about the petrophysical properties of the rocks and helps to determine how accurate the velocity model is. This blog post looks at the price-performance characteristics computing Kirchhoff migration methods on GPUs using Nvidias GPU-optimized code.</p>

          <p>High Performance Computing (HPC) is known as a domain where applications are well-optimized to get the highest performance possible on a platform. Unsurprisingly, a common question when moving a workload to AWS is what performance difference there may be from an existing on-premises bare metal platform. This blog will show the performance differential between bare metal instances and instances that use the AWS Nitro hypervisor is negligible for the evaluated HPC workloads.</p>

          <p>Recent events, from public sector cyberattacks and severe weather events to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, have revealed that many educational institutions, as well as regional and local governments, are not fully prepared to respond to these incidents. At the same time, large-scale disruptive events illustrate how important it is for public sector organizations to respond rapidly to keep essential services running as well as quickly pivot to offer new services. In an IDC survey of 2,000 U.S. residents in September 2020, 31% said they would like to continue virtual government services as a replacement for in-person interactions, while another IDC survey of U.S. teachers revealed that 38% expect a growth in hybrid or remote learning to be a lasting change.</p>
