          <p>In any business intelligence system, securing and restricting access to the data is important. For example, you might want a particular dashboard to only be viewed by the users with whom the dashboard has been shared, yet customize the data displayed on that dashboard per user by implementing row-level security. With row-level security, you can [...]</p>

          <p>At Lemongrass, an AWS Premier Consulting Partner, the thinking is that a regionally resilient design is more than sufficient for many organizations, as it meets and exceeds what is typically run on-premises today. Learn how they couple this with the backup images/snaps being replicated into a second region “just in case” so there is an image from which to rebuild the landscape. It’s the sweet spot between too much (compute) and too little (+risk), plus it protects against root account compromise in a public cloud.</p>

This makes weather radars an invaluable tool for scientists seeking to further the understanding of atmospheric processes and anything else that happens to be flying through the radar’s field of view.
