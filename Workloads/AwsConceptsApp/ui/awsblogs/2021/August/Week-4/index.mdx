          <p>Increasingly, a business&#8217;s success depends on its agility in transforming data into actionable insights, which requires efficient and automated data processes. In the previous post &#8211; Build a SQL-based ETL pipeline with Apache Spark on Amazon EKS, we described a common productivity issue in a modern data architecture. To address the challenge, we demonstrated how to utilize a declarative approach as the key enabler to improve efficiency, which resulted in a faster time to value for businesses. Generally speaking, managing applications declaratively in Kubernetes is a widely adopted best practice. You can use the same approach to build and deploy Spark applications with open-source or in-house build frameworks to achieve the same productivity goal.</p>

          <p>Microservices commonly communicate with JSON over HTTP/1.1. These technologies are ubiquitous and human-readable, but they aren’t optimized for communication between dozens or hundreds of microservices. Next-generation Web technologies, including gRPC and HTTP/2, significantly improve communication speed and efficiency between microservices. AWS offers the most complete platform for builders implementing microservices &#8212; and the addition of HTTP/2 and gRPC support in Application Load Balancer (ALB) provides an end-to-end solution for next-generation microservices. ALBs can inspect and route gRPC calls, enabling features like health checks, access logs, and gRPC-specific metrics. This post demonstrates .NET microservices communicating with gRPC via Application Load Balancers.</p>
