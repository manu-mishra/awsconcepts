          <p>Government, education, nonprofit, healthcare, and other public sector organizations process and store sensitive data including health records, tax data, PII, student data, criminal justice information, and financial data. These workloads carry stringent security and compliance requirements to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this data both in transit and at rest. Best practices for protection of data in transit include enforcing appropriately defined encryption requirements, authenticating network communications, and implementing secure key and certificate management systems. In this post, I demonstrate a solution for deploying a highly available and fault tolerant web service with managed certificates and TLS termination performed on customer-managed EC2 Nitro instances using ACM for Nitro Enclaves.</p>

Because of the popularity of these applications, public sector organisations such as educational institutions should protect their business continuity by implementing disaster recovery (DR) solutions: policies, tools, and procedures to help the recovery or continuation of technology infrastructure and systems following a disaster. AWS Professional Services created a business continuity solution for on-premises LAMP applications that could eliminate the need for physical backup infrastructure and improve recovery time. The solution was recently piloted by Cardiff University.</p>

          <p>When I travel around the world, I try to spend time with women leaders in different organizations, industries, and walks of life. In the time we have together, I try to learn about their hopes and dreams. In those conversations, I hear both a desire to think big about the future and a struggle to balance the commitments and responsibilities that fall almost exclusively to women. The numbers are clear: the percentage of the women participating in the global labor force is declining. I recently wrote about steps we can take to recover from the last year. Today, I want to share three stories that make me hopeful that we can collectively achieve gender parity.</p>

          <p>Consumer expectations are always changing, which means retailers are often playing catch-up to align their offerings with customers evolving behaviors. The pandemic illuminated the chasm between the retailers who have kept pace with market changes and those who have struggled.

          <p>Many organizations including the intelligence community, security organizations, law enforcement, regulatory bodies, news organizations, and non-governmental organizations work together to disrupt transnational crime networks. Their missions include combating illicit trade; disrupting human, animal, and narcotics trafficking; detecting money laundering; and exposing political corruption. This community needs rapid analysis of large, diverse streams of information about air transportation networks, because air transportation is the fastest way to conduct illicit trade internationally. The nonprofit Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS) built the Icarus Flights application to meet this need. By building on AWS using managed cloud services, C4ADS spends less time and energy managing infrastructure, which frees them to focus on building innovative analytics and alerting services that their user community needs.</p>

          <p>Severe and extreme weather events not only wreak havoc on lives, property and the economy, but the extent of the destruction and devastation left behind can be difficult to map and quantify. Having high resolution imagery of areas devastated by weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and etc.) helps to characterize impacts, formulate needed recovery and response activities, support emergency managers in saving lives, and restart the flow of commerce. NOAAs data plays a critical role in this process. As part of ASDI, we invited Jena Kent from NOAAs Big Data Program to share how AWS is helping with disaster response by providing access to aerial data and imagery through open data initiatives.</p>

The test-bed project is part of a wider program set up by Oxford University with support from AWS. Researchers have been as surprised by how quickly they have reached results as they are pleased with the outcomes. One of the test-beds, the Oxford X-Reality Hub Ed Tech project, set out to investigate how virtual reality (VR) could transform the classroom experience and close the gap between disadvantaged groups of pupils who statistically do less well than their peers.</p>

          <p>Cloud infrastructure provides more agility than traditional IT, meaning organizations must think differently about how they design, build, and manage applications. Cloud resources need a stronger integration between IT and organizational governance, as builders need to be able to operate in a cloud environment thats agile and safe. Hear from APN Ambassador Paolo Latella, who introduces a decentralized model of cloud governance that can help you strike the right balance between agility and safety.</p>

          <p>Blockchain is being compared with the network of networks, and rightly so as the traits between both are similar. The introduction of more technology platforms gives users choice but also increases the siloes. To make a blockchain network work in an enterprise, there has to be a glue which sticks all of these platforms together. Learn how AWS Premier Consulting Partner HCLTech built a highly scalable, cost-effective, and easy-to-integrate blockchain platform called CoTrust that is architected to deploy on AWS.</p>

          <p>Today, the healthcare industry is flooded with software. Any given hospital has an EMR, billing software, different portals for every insurance partner, and individual medical tools each with their own interfaces, just to name a few. None of these systems work together, and the downstream effects dehumanizes the care experience. Olive is designed to connect these disparate parts, shining a new light on old processes, connecting providers delivering care and payers reimbursing that care to ultimately drive a better patient experience.</p>

          <p>In the spring of 2019, environmental modelers at the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO) had a new problem to solve. Emerging research on air pollution along the shores of the Great Lakes in the United States showed that to properly simulate the pollution episodes in the region we needed to apply our models at a finer spatial granularity than the computational capacity of our in-house HPC cluster could handle. The LADCO modelers turned to AWS ParallelCluster to access the HPC resources needed to do this modeling faster and scale for our member states.</p>

SEON was essentially founded to tackle all of these problems.</p>

And innovation is best served by a diverse team, which is why we support organizations like Girls in Tech, a global nonprofit of more than 70,000 members, that advocates for diversity, equality, and inclusion in the technology industry.A report from NCWIT found that women earned 57% of all bachelors degrees in 2019, yet only 21% of computer and information sciences bachelors degrees. And while women hold 57% of all professional occupations in the US workforce, they hold only 26% of all computing occupations.And, the numbers of women in STEM drop down to the low single digits when you look at BIPOC women. It is clearthe time for change is now.</p>

          <p>According to the IFC, small business ownership in South Africa reflects patterns of racial and gender-based inequality in the broader South African society, and as the size of businesses grows, the rates of black and female ownership decline. At AWS, we believe that building diverse teams allows us to innovate better for our customers. To work toward this, in 2019, AWS South Africa launched the AWS Equity Equivalent Investment Program (AWS EEIP), as part of its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) program. The AWS EEIP is a Partner development and acceleration program for 100% black owned small IT businesses in South Africa. Applications for the 2021 intake are now open.</p>
