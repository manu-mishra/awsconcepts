          <p>Times Higher Education (THE) is a data-driven business that, with the help of AWS, is now realising the value of their data, which enables them to be better informed and make faster decisions for customers. THE provides a broad range of services to help set the agenda in higher education, and their insights help universities improve through performance analysis. THE worked with the AWS Data Lab to create a centralised repository of their data. Launching a data lake helped with providing a cost-effective platform and cataloguing data so they could understand their data and design new products to make use of it.</p>

          <p>For customers in the United States, patients must have access to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information in their medical records beginning April 5, 2021. While most health systems have one EHR in place, others who have undergone mergers may have several EHR solutions. All of this contributes to the challenge of achieving healthcare interoperability. This post shows how Redox, an AWS Partner and EHR integration platform, accelerates healthcare interoperability for customers.</p>

          <p>Cloud infrastructure provides more agility than traditional IT, meaning organizations must think differently about how they design, build, and manage applications. Cloud resources need a stronger integration between IT and organizational governance, as builders need to be able to operate in a cloud environment thats agile and safe. Hear from APN Ambassador Paolo Latella, who introduces a decentralized model of cloud governance that can help you strike the right balance between agility and safety.</p>
