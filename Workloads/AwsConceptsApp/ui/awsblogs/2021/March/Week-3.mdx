          <p>AWS gives you the components that you need to build systems that are highly reliable: multiple Regions (each with multiple Availability Zones), Amazon CloudWatch (metrics, monitoring, and alarms), Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, several forms of cross-region replication, and lots more. When you put them together in line with the guidance provided in the Well-Architected Framework, [...]</p>

          <p>Severe and extreme weather events not only wreak havoc on lives, property and the economy, but the extent of the destruction and devastation left behind can be difficult to map and quantify. Having high resolution imagery of areas devastated by weather events (hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and etc.) helps to characterize impacts, formulate needed recovery and response activities, support emergency managers in saving lives, and restart the flow of commerce. NOAAs data plays a critical role in this process. As part of ASDI, we invited Jena Kent from NOAAs Big Data Program to share how AWS is helping with disaster response by providing access to aerial data and imagery through open data initiatives.</p>

Rather than sending data files everywhere, AWS offers a simple way to store your data in one central location so that you can read your data into SAS and still share it with other colleagues. In this blog post, I will explain how to export your data, store it in AWS, and query the data using SAS.</p>

          <p>With in-person collaboration limited for much of 2020 and the foreseeable future, educational institutions have embraced new virtual means to connect with students and deliver information like classroom lectures, conferences, and dissertation presentations online. Recognizing the value and importance of high quality virtual collaboration, educational technology companies (EdTech) have been working to maintain the benefits of an in-person experience, for speakers as well as audiences, in online environments. Inspired by the increased demand for sophisticated virtual collaboration solutions, EdTech Mosaic Learning built and integrated new Amazon Web Services (AWS) features into its custom platform tailored for delivering dynamic video experiences at scale.</p>
