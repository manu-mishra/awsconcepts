          <p>The Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), AWS is donating cloud resources, technical support, and access to scalable infrastructure and fast networking providing high performance computing solutions to support simulations of near-term climate using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model Version 2 (CESM2) and its Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). In collaboration with ASDI, AWS, and SilverLining, a nonprofit dedicated to ensuring a safe climate, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will run an ensemble of 30 climate-model simulations on AWS. The climate runs will simulate the Earth system over the period of years 2022-2070 under a median scenario for warming and make them available through the AWS Open Data Program. The simulation work will demonstrate the ability to use cloud infrastructure to advance climate models in support of robust scientific studies by researchers around the world and aims to accelerate and democratize climate science.</p>

          <p>It&#8217;s time consuming for public sector organizations to sort through packed voicemail inboxes, figure out how to respond, return calls, and take detailed records on each call. So AWS developed a scalable call center solution that allows organizations to streamline the entire call process – from call intake, to generating actionable insights for response with artificial intelligence, to detailed recordkeeping and storage. This blog post guides you through how to create this task-generating cloud call center solution with Amazon Connect.</p>

          <p>This post showed how to implement the saga orchestration pattern using API Gateway, Step Functions, Lambda, DynamoDB, and .NET Core 3.1. This can help maintain data integrity in distributed transactions across multiple services. Step Functions makes it easier to implement the orchestration in the saga pattern.</p>

          <p>Playtech mathematicians and game designers need accurate, detailed game play simulation results to create fun experiences for players. While software developers have been able to iterate on code in an agile manner for many years, for non-analytical solutions, mathematicians have had to rely on slow CPU-bound Monte-Carlo simulations, waiting, as software engineers once did, many hours or overnight to get the results of their latest changes. These statistics are also required as evidence of game fairness in the highly regulated online gaming business. Playtech has developed an AWS Lambda Serverless based solution that provides massive burst compute performance that allows game simulations in minutes rather than hours. This post goes into the details of the architecture, as well as some examples of using the system in our development and operations.</p>

          <p>At re:Invent 2020, we introduced Amazon Managed Grafana and made it available in preview. Since then, we’ve been working on numerous enhancements that were made available during preview. Now we’re excited to launch Amazon Managed Grafana in General Availability (GA), and with this post we’ll lay out exactly what this means. Figure 1: List of [...]</p>
