          <p>The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) is responsible for running atmospheric, climate and ocean models covering the kingdom of Denmark. We worked together with the DMI to port and run a full numerical weather prediction (NWP) cycling dataflow with the Harmonie Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model to AWS. You can find a report of the porting and operational experience in the ACCORD community newsletter. In this blog post, we expand on that report to present the initial timing results from running the forecast component of Harmonie model on AWS. We also present these as-is timing results together with as-is timings attained on the supercomputing systems based on Cray XC40 and Intel Xeon based Cray XC50.</p>

          <p>Ten years ago, the federal government was only just beginning to adopt cloud computing services. In the early days, there were concerns about how much cloud services would cost and whether theyd be secure enough for sensitive government data. In listening to our government customers, we heard their concerns about cost and security. They also needed to innovate ahead of demand, and required a highly secure and compliant infrastructure to do it. Thats why we launched AWS GovCloud (US) in 2011.</p>

          <p>This week, AWS rolled out our 10-year economic impact study, highlighting how successful the partnership between Virginia and AWS has been for both. Since 2011, AWS has invested $35 billion into the state through our infrastructure investments. As both a Virginian and an Amazonian, Im most proud of the civic programs and workforce development weve created with Virginia to enhance the lives of citizens with our presence. Terry Dickerson, a practice manager at AWS and U.S. Army veteran, is an illustration of the success weve realized with Amazons Veteran Technical Apprenticeship. Terry shares his story of how our partnership with the higher education system in Virginia has opened the door to his career.</p>

          <p>Event driven programs use events to initiate succeeding steps in a process. For example, the completion of an upload job may then initiate an image processing job. This allows developers to create complex architectures by using the principle of decoupling. Decoupling is preferable for many workflows, as it allows each component to perform its tasks [...]</p>

          <p>Education, government, and nonprofit organizations seek to deliver quality services to support their missions in increasingly dynamic and complex environments, all while facing common challenges, such as shortage of systems to collect and analyze data in real-time. To support public sector organizations on their missions and with the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), Amazon Web Service (AWS) is launching the AWS IoT Rapid Adoption Assistance Initiative for AWS Partners.</p>

          <p>A serverless face blurring service can provide a simpler way to process photos in workloads with large amounts of traffic. This post introduces an example application that blurs faces when images are saved in an S3 bucket. The S3 PutObject event invokes a Lambda function that uses Amazon Rekognition to detect faces and GraphicsMagick to process the images.</p>
