We worked together with the DMI to port and run a full numerical weather prediction (NWP) cycling dataflow with the Harmonie Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model to AWS. You can find a report of the porting and operational experience in the ACCORD community newsletter. In this blog post, we expand on that report to present the initial timing results from running the forecast component of Harmonie model on AWS. We also present these as-is timing results together with as-is timings attained on the supercomputing systems based on Cray XC40 and Intel Xeon based Cray XC50.</p>

They also needed to innovate ahead of demand, and required a highly secure and compliant infrastructure to do it. Thats why we launched AWS GovCloud (US) in 2011.</p>

As both a Virginian and an Amazonian, Im most proud of the civic programs and workforce development weve created with Virginia to enhance the lives of citizens with our presence. Terry Dickerson, a practice manager at AWS and U.S. Army veteran, is an illustration of the success weve realized with Amazons Veteran Technical Apprenticeship.

Amazon EC2 Spot Instances offer a cost-effective architectural choice, allowing you to take advantage of unused EC2 capacity for up to a 90% discount compared to On-Demand Instance prices. In this post, we describe how you 0can run fault-tolerant FEA workloads on Spot Instances using Ansys LS-DYNAs checkpointing and auto-restart utility.</p>
