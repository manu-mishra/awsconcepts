          <p>Many SaaS applications boast of microservices as a means to divide a monolithic architecture into easily manageable solutions. Sometimes these microservices have their own databases. To maintain data consistency across the system, you need to implement a data synchronization system between source and target data persistence layers. Learn how Trantor has developed a solution using Amazon AppFlow to easily synchronize the data between Salesforce and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL in near real-time.</p>

          <p>Providing access through Azure AD to AWS GovCloud (US) reduces the number of credentials administrators need to manage and use for access to AWS GovCloud (US) and can also increase security to the account by using the same Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) mechanism used with Azure AD. This access also allows the use of scripts and programs to help manage resources in the AWS accounts. This post is a walkthrough of using an open-source utility called saml2aws to provide programmatic access to AWS for Azure AD users.</p>
