This is a challenge not only for people without legal ID, but also for individuals with ID documents that are hard to use digitally. Cloud-based digital ID systems can be a solution to this challenge. Plus, digital ID creates a robust scope of benefits and cloud-based approaches to implementing these systems provide the speed, scale, and security needed for digital ID to succeed.</p>
