          <p>The AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program makes high-value, cloud-optimized datasets publicly available on AWS. We work with data providers to democratize access to data by making it available to the public for analysis on AWS; develop new cloud-native techniques, formats, and tools that lower the cost of working with data; and encourage the development of communities that benefit from access to shared datasets. Our full list of publicly available datasets are on the Registry of Open Data on AWS. This quarter, we released 26 new or updated datasets including datasets on climate, koala genomes, analysis ready radar data, and highly-queryable genomic data. Check out some highlights.</p>
