          <p>The United Kingdom (UK) healthcare systems acceleration of innovation in service delivery, along with its increased adoption of digitally-enabled, secure, and compliant solutions through the Covid-19 crisis has brought about great benefit for patients. Embracing digital health innovations has enabled the NHS to deliver a world-leading vaccination programme showing their inherent talent and collaborative, patient-centric capacity to transform at pace. Now, their focus moves to tackling backlogs in elective care, continuing to implement the NHS Long Term Plan, and focusing on transformation of services to support NHS resilience. To support both high-potential healthcare startups and the UK healthcare systems demand for these types of solutions, we are excited to announce the launch of the AWS Healthcare Accelerator programme in the UK.</p>

In this post, I show you how to bypass most local emulation by testing serverless applications in the [...]</p>

          <p>As governments around the world digitize services, individuals are required not only to prove their identities, but to do so on digital channels. This is a challenge not only for people without legal ID, but also for individuals with ID documents that are hard to use digitally. Cloud-based digital ID systems can be a solution to this challenge. Plus, digital ID creates a robust scope of benefits and cloud-based approaches to implementing these systems provide the speed, scale, and security needed for digital ID to succeed.</p>

The infrastructure tends to scale out to meet ever increasing demand as the analyses look at more and finer grained data. At AWS weve helped many customers tackle scaling challenges are noticing some common themes. In this post we describe how HPC teams are thinking about how they deliver compute capacity today, and highlight how we see the solutions converging for the future.</p>

          <p>Recently, we talked about the advances NICE DCV has made to push pixels from cloud-hosted desktops or applications over the internet even more efficiently than before. Since we published that post on this blog channel, weve been asked by several customers whether all this efficient pixel-pushing could lead to outbound data charges moving up on their AWS bill. We decided to try it on your behalf, and share the details with you in this post. The bottom line? The charges are unlikely to be significant unless youre doing intensive streaming (such as gaming) and other cost optimizations (like AWS Instance Savings Plans) that will have more impact on your bill.</p>

We work with data providers to democratize access to data by making it available to the public for analysis on AWS; develop new cloud-native techniques, formats, and tools that lower the cost of working with data; and encourage the development of communities that benefit from access to shared datasets. Our full list of publicly available datasets are on the Registry of Open Data on AWS. This quarter, we released 26 new or updated datasets including datasets on climate, koala genomes, analysis ready radar data, and highly-queryable genomic data. Check out some highlights.</p>
