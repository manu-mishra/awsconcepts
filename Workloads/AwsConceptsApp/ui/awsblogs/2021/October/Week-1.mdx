          <p>There has been a lot of buzz about a new data architecture design pattern called a Lake House. A Lake House approach integrates a data lake with the data warehouse and all of the purpose-built stores so customers no longer have to take a one-size-fits-all approach and are able to select the storage that best suits their needs. Learn how to couple Amazon Redshift with a semantic layer from AtScale to deliver fast, agile, and analysis-ready data to business analysts and data scientists.</p>

          <p>Load Shedding Load shedding is the practice of sacrificing enough application traffic to keep partial availability in the presence of an overload condition.
