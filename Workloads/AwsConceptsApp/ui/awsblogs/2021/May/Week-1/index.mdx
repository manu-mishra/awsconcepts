          <p>We occasionally run into startups that built their initial MVP on Firebase but desire to switch to AWS to achieve operations at scale with better data quality and reliability guarantees, and at lower cost. With Firebase consisting of proprietary services, APIs, and an SDK, a migration to AWS requires application refactoring introducing a new architecture using AWS services, and rewriting parts of the codebase to use them accordingly. To minimize the disruption of this refactoring, this guide will help you identify what AWS services are best suited for your startups new architecture along with some implementation strategies to ease and accelerate the cutover.</p>

          <p>As the industry grows with more data volume, big data analytics is becoming a common requirement in data analytics and machine learning (ML) use cases. Analysts are building complex data transformation pipelines that include multiple steps for data preparation and cleansing. However, analysts may want a simpler orchestration mechanism with a graphical user interface that [...]</p>

          <p>Feature toggles (or feature flags) are a software development technique allowing developers to programmatically enable or disable features of an application. In practice, feature toggles control a systems behavior by controlling conditional statements in the application code. Feature toggles have a number of use cases: Selectively enable or disable features You can use feature [...]</p>

          <p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed service that helps customers run their Kubernetes (K8s) clusters at scale by minimizing the effort required to operate the Kubernetes control plane. When you combine Amazon EKS to manage the cluster (the control plane) with AWS Fargate to provision and run pod infrastructure (the data [...]</p>
