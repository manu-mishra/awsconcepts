          <p>Today, more than 290,000 researchers in France are working to provide better support and care for patients through modern medical treatment. To fulfill their mission, these researchers must be equipped with powerful tools. At AWS, we believe that technology has a critical role to play in medical research. Why? Because technology can take advantage of the significant amount of data generated in the healthcare system and in the research community to enable opportunities for more accurate diagnoses, and better treatments for many existing and future diseases. To support elite research in France, we are proud to be a sponsor of two French organizations: Gustave Roussy and Sorbonne University. AWS is providing them with the computing power and machine learning technologies needed to accelerate cancer research and develop a treatment for COVID-19.</p>

          <p>In speaking with AWS Partners of all sizes and areas of expertise, its clear there is a growing need for getting more robust, more powerful AWS technology to the edge, in more clever ways than before. AWS Outposts is a service that allows customers to run a subset of AWS serviceson fully managed AWS hardwarelocated in their own data center, remote office, production plant, or virtually anywhere they want them to be. The art of the possible, as clich as it can sometimes be, really does start there.</p>

          <p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new type of digital asset that seems to be the hot topic of conversation everywhere. NFTs are described as nonsensical by skeptics, digital beanie babies or baseball cards by most, and a revolutionary new idea that will change everything from digital content to the way artists interact with fans by true believers. Ive worked on NFTs in my role at Origin Protocol and I have already seen first hand how they are game changers in a number of industries. In this blog, I will briefly introduce you to the universe of NFTs and I will also teach you how to mint your own NFTs and sell them on a variety of platforms and marketplaces.</p>

          <p>Training users on how to use high performance computing resources and the data that comes out as a result of those analyses is an essential function of most research organizations. Having a robust, scalable, and easy-to-use platform for on-site and remote training is becoming a requirement for creating a community around your research mission. A great example of this comes from the NOAA National Weather Service Warning Decision Training Division (WDTD), which develops and delivers training on the integrated elements of the hazardous weather warning process within a National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office. In collaboration with the University of Oklahomas Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies (OU/CIMMS), WDTD conducts its flagship course, the Radar and Applications Course (RAC), for forecasters issuing warnings for flash floods, severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes. Trainees learn the warning process, the science and application of conceptual models, and technical aspects of analyzing radar and other weather data in the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS).</p>

          <p>Within AWS IoT fleet deployments, each connected device needs to have unique, trusted, verifiable identity. While Linux OS provides strong protection from unauthorized user access, its still possible to compromise the system if the attacker has full physical access to the device. NXP EdgeLock SE050 prevents attackers from extracting the private key even if the physical integrity of the device is compromised and the attacker managed to get access to the device filesystem.</p>

          <p>With AWS Ground Station, you can now deliver data directly into Amazon S3 buckets. This simplifies downlinking because you no longer need to run an Amazon EC2 receiver instance. It also saves you cost and simplifies the creation of automated processing pipelines like the one we are going to show in this blog. By using an automated Earth observation (EO) pipeline, you can reduce the operating burden of your staff, as after scheduling a contact, everything is handled automatically and youll get a notification when the processed data is available. Read on to learn how to create an automated EO pipeline that receives and processes data from the NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) satellite, using this new AWS Ground Station feature.</p>

          <p>State and local governments (SLGs) are constantly looking for ways to improve the lives and well-being of their constituents. They strive for increased efficiencies in delivering existing government services or potential new services such as those related to assistance with food, health, education, affordable housing, weatherization, and more. Enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions, along with ancillary business systems that support performance-based budgeting, play a key role in providing data insights. The balancing act between tight budgets and enablement of government services is enabled by fiscal health, sound policies, and data insights. ERP systems deployed on the cloud can help with the capabilities and technology tools that governments need to derive efficiencies with existing services and deploy new services.</p>

          <p>Children become aware of traditional careers at a young age. But the careers in modern science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) that are likely to be among the most in-demand when the children enter the workforce arent traditionally introduced to younger students. Many cloud occupations are absent in the aspirational pathways commonly discussed in STEAM education. Aspiring tech students are not aware of the full breadth of cloud jobs that exist, and are often pushed a narrow view limited to coding, video game production, and software development. To address these gaps, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Flight Works Alabama (an Airbus Americas 501c3) created the program We Build It Better.</p>

          <p>The maturing of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought ready-made services that organizations can use, not only to automate data entry work but also to apply intelligence into the business process. Using modern AI capabilities on AWS, organizations can transform approaches to document management. This allows public sector organizations to save time (enabling faster throughput especially during higher volume paperwork times), so they can help get constituents their services faster, and focus on the most valuable work of the high-touch or high-need cases. Document automation helps reduce human entry error and provide backup services in case of natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Nonprofits have found themselves thrust into a digital-first landscape, with an increasing demand for virtual or remote services for beneficiaries, donors, volunteers, and staff. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nonprofit organizations put forth tremendous effort to fill gaps unmet by the government and private sectors for our communities. Nonprofits have shown agility in their pivot to online events, remote service delivery, sharing of data and research, and more. To help nonprofits access the best-in-class tools provided by AWS, today we are launching the 2021 AWS Imagine Grant program. Guidelines and instructions on how to apply for this years cycle are available today.</p>

          <p>We occasionally run into startups that built their initial MVP on Firebase but desire to switch to AWS to achieve operations at scale with better data quality and reliability guarantees, and at lower cost. With Firebase consisting of proprietary services, APIs, and an SDK, a migration to AWS requires application refactoring introducing a new architecture using AWS services, and rewriting parts of the codebase to use them accordingly. To minimize the disruption of this refactoring, this guide will help you identify what AWS services are best suited for your startups new architecture along with some implementation strategies to ease and accelerate the cutover.</p>
