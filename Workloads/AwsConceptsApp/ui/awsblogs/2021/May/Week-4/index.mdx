          <p>In speaking with AWS Partners of all sizes and areas of expertise, its clear there is a growing need for getting more robust, more powerful AWS technology to the edge, in more clever ways than before. AWS Outposts is a service that allows customers to run a subset of AWS serviceson fully managed AWS hardwarelocated in their own data center, remote office, production plant, or virtually anywhere they want them to be. The art of the possible, as clich as it can sometimes be, really does start there.</p>

          <p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new type of digital asset that seems to be the hot topic of conversation everywhere. NFTs are described as nonsensical by skeptics, digital beanie babies or baseball cards by most, and a revolutionary new idea that will change everything from digital content to the way artists interact with fans by true believers. Ive worked on NFTs in my role at Origin Protocol and I have already seen first hand how they are game changers in a number of industries. In this blog, I will briefly introduce you to the universe of NFTs and I will also teach you how to mint your own NFTs and sell them on a variety of platforms and marketplaces.</p>

          <p>This is a guest post by Maria Teleczuk, research engineer at the Paris-Saclay Center for Data Science (CDS), and Alexandre Gramfort, senior research scientist at INRIA, the French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology. Maria and Alexandre explain how they adapted their open source data challenge platform RAMP to train the models submitted by student challenge participants using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Spot instances, and how they leveraged AWS to support three student challenges.</p>

          <p>Training users on how to use high performance computing resources and the data that comes out as a result of those analyses is an essential function of most research organizations. Having a robust, scalable, and easy-to-use platform for on-site and remote training is becoming a requirement for creating a community around your research mission. A great example of this comes from the NOAA National Weather Service Warning Decision Training Division (WDTD), which develops and delivers training on the integrated elements of the hazardous weather warning process within a National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office. In collaboration with the University of Oklahomas Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies (OU/CIMMS), WDTD conducts its flagship course, the Radar and Applications Course (RAC), for forecasters issuing warnings for flash floods, severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes. Trainees learn the warning process, the science and application of conceptual models, and technical aspects of analyzing radar and other weather data in the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS).</p>

          <p>Within AWS IoT fleet deployments, each connected device needs to have unique, trusted, verifiable identity. While Linux OS provides strong protection from unauthorized user access, its still possible to compromise the system if the attacker has full physical access to the device. NXP EdgeLock SE050 prevents attackers from extracting the private key even if the physical integrity of the device is compromised and the attacker managed to get access to the device filesystem.</p>
