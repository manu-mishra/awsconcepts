          <p>Even though the speedometer in my car maxes out at 150 MPH, I rarely drive at that speed (and the top end may be more optimistic than realistic), but it is certainly nice to have the option to do so when the time and the circumstances are right. Most of the time I am using [...]</p>

          <p>When Amazon Redshift first launched, I discussed its disruptive price, performance, and ease of use. One year later, we added faster and more cost-effective SSD-based nodes to the Redshift arsenal. The pace of Redshift innovation has only quickened, with over 60 new features added since launch, 12 of which I showcased last month. Today, I&#8217;m [...]</p>

          <p>You can use Amazon ElastiCache to add a scalable caching layer to your application. As you may already know, you can use ElastiCache to create a Memcached or Redis Cache Cluster comprised of one or more Cache Nodes.
