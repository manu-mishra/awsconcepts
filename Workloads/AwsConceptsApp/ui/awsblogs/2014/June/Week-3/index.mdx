          <p>Since Guzzle 4 was released in March (and even before then), weve received several requests for us to update the AWS SDK for PHP to use Guzzle 4. Earlier this month, we tweeted about it too and received some pretty positive feedback about the idea. We wanted to take some time to talk about what [...]</p>

          <p>As one of our most active customers, Netflix has hundreds of administrators who need access to AWS daily. Therefore, by eliminating their need to use AWS credentials via identity federation, they saved time, money, and administrative effort almost immediately.
