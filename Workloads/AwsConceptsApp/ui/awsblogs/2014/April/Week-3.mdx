          <p>A standard deck of cards has 52 different playing cards and 2 jokers. If we shuffle a deck thoroughly and deal out a four card hand, there are over 300,000 different hands. Another way to say the same thing is that if we put the cards back, shuffle and deal again, the odds are worse [...]</p>

          <p>We have made some important changes to the EC2 pricing and instance type pages. We are introducing the concept of previous generations of EC2 instances. Amazon EC2 has been around since the summer of 2006. We started with a single instance (the venerable and still-popular m1.small) and have added many over the years. We have [...]</p>

          <p>Have you shopped at AWS Marketplace lately? The selection keeps on growing and you can easily find, buy, and starting many different types of Software Infrastructure, Developer Tools, and Business Software: You dont need to worry about procuring a server, installing and configuring an operating system, or installing the actual software that you set out [...]</p>

          <p>We have reviewed all AWS services for impact by CVE-2014-0160 (also known as the Heartbleed bug) and have either determined that the services were unaffected or weve applied mitigations that do not require customer action. In a few cases, we are recommending that customers rotate SSL certificates or secret keys. For additional detail see AWS [...]</p>

          <p>Change is inevitable except from a vending machine. Or so says Robert C. Gallagher. I personally strongly agree with him, especially regarding the email industry. Lately weve been hearing about changes mailbox providers are making that challenge us to rethink the way we send email. Here is the latest one: Yahoo.com changed their Domain-based [...]</p>
