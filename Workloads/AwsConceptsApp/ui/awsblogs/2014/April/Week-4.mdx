          <p>Sometimes, when sending requests using the AWS SDK for .NET, you are required to explicitly specify an endpoint URL for a service. One such scenario is when you use an older version of the SDK to send requests to a particular service and that service is introduced in a new region. To access the service [...]</p>

          <p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy for you to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud. After you upload your application, Elastic Beanstalk will provision, monitor, and scale capacity (Amazon EC2 instances), while also load balancing incoming requests across all of the healthy instances. Docker automates the deployment of applications in the form of [...]</p>

          <p>The Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) takes care of almost all of the day to day grunt work that would otherwise consume a lot of system administrator and DBA time. You dont have to worry about hardware provisioning, operating system or database installation or patching, backups, monitoring, or failover. Instead, you can invest in your [...]</p>

          <p>You can use Amazon ElastiCache to implement an in-memory storage layer between your application code and your database using the Memcached or Redis engines. Adding an in-memory storage layer can often lead to dramatic speed improvements for database accesses. Regardless of which engine you choose, ElastiCache makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale a [...]</p>

          <p>Amazon DynamoDB is a fast, fully-managed NoSQL database. You can easily create tables, provision the desired amount of read and write capacity, and then store as much information as youd like. Each item in a DynamoDB table consists of one or more key/value pairs, indexed by a hash key or a combination of a hash [...]</p>
