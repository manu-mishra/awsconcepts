          <p>Version 1 of the AWS SDK for Ruby (aws-sdk gem) depends on Nokogiri and JSON. While these are robust and performant libraries, there are multiple reasons why a developer may not want to be locked into these dependencies: I might want to use pure Ruby solutions that do not require native extensions for maximum portability.

          <p>One of my favorite features of version 2 of the AWS SDK for Ruby (aws-sdk-core gem) is the new parameter validation system. One of the challenges in using an API library is understanding how to specify request parameters. During development stages it is common to make mistakes and to generate errors. Using the version 1 [...]</p>

          <p>Version 1 of the AWS SDK for Ruby (aws-sdk gem) provides a higher-level abstraction for working with AWS resources. These resources can be used to get information about AWS objects and operate on them as well. For example: AWS.ec2.instances.each do |i| puts i.instance_id + =&gt; + i.status.to_s end The problem with the example [...]</p>
