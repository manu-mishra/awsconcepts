          <p>Version 1 of the AWS SDK for Ruby (aws-sdk gem) depends on Nokogiri and JSON. While these are robust and performant libraries, there are multiple reasons why a developer may not want to be locked into these dependencies: I might want to use pure Ruby solutions that do not require native extensions for maximum portability.

One of the challenges in using an API library is understanding how to specify request parameters. During development stages it is common to make mistakes and to generate errors.
