          <p>One of my favorite aspects of working with Ruby is how natural it is to write tests for. The Ruby community does an excellent job of encouraging authors to produce well tested code. There is a plethora of well supported tools to choose from. I like to joke that new Ruby developers write Micro test [...]</p>

          <p>In version 2.0.2.3 of the SDK we added an enhancement to the SDK to make it easier to subscribe an Amazon SQS queue to an Amazon SNS topic. You have always been able to subscribe queues to topics using the Subscribe method on the SNS client, but after you subscribed to the topic with your [...]</p>

This feature builds upon our existing support for read replicas that reside within the same region as the source database instance.

          <p>In a previous blog post, I introduced Minitest from the perspective of RSpec. Some Minitest users prefer to avoid the specification style of Minitest::Spec. Instead they use Minitest::Test. Its closer to the metal and uses a more vanilla Ruby syntax. Here is an example spec file using Minitest::Spec: require spec_helper describe MyClass do describe #some_method [...]</p>

          <p>Ever thought about generating metrics that measure your applications performance on accessing AWS, and then having those metrics uploaded to Amazon CloudWatch for visualization or monitoring purposes ? How about generating performance metrics of your JVMs when used against AWS ? Wouldnt it be nice to capture and visualize metrics related to the runtime environment [...]</p>
