          <p>Version 2.4 of the AWS SDK for PHP adds the ability to enable and use static client facades.

          <p>AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. You can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment.

          <p>Earlier this year we introduced a new DNS failover feature for Amazon Route 53.
