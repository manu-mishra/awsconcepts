          <p>The majority of the cmdlets in the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell require that you specify an AWS region.

          <p>One of the benefits of AWS is the highly available, durable, and practically unlimited cloud-based storage you can get with Amazon Simple Storage Services (Amazon S3).
