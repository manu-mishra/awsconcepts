          <p>During my recent trip to Southeast Asia, several people asked me if we had plans to bring Amazon CloudFront and Route 53 to India. I responded as I always do &#8212; that we continue to invest and to expand, that we listen to our users, and that we make use of traffic and usage trends [...]</p>

          <p>If you&#8217;re a frequent reader of this blog, you probably know that AWS recommends as a security best practice that you set up one or more AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users for interaction with AWS services, rather than use your root account. Why? The credentials for your AWS root account provide full access [...]</p>
