          <p>WPF/E is Microsofts next-generation presentation for creating rich web experiences.

          <p>Its gratifying to see third-party projects that interface with Amazon Web Services. For example, you can download a Perl Interface to Amazon EC2 from Jeff Kim on CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network), released on December 28th. Check it out at search.cpan.org/~jkim/Net-Amazon-EC2-0.02. Mike Update: Title of post changed from PHP to Perl!</p>

          <p>Last last year I announced that an unnamed company was conducting a live seminar in the Seattle area and that they were holding some spaces open for AWS developers. I was able to attend that session, and can report that I saw some really, really cool development tools. In the space of the day I [...]</p>

Using a Flash application which is actually embedded in the body of the HIT, workers tag a sequential series of images to denote the presence of certain road features yellow lines, manholes, drains, bollards, and pedestrian crossings.

          <p>I blogged about Hadoop on EC2 late last year. In a nutshell, Hadoop is an open source implementation of Googles MapReduce algorithm. MapReduce is a simple and efficient programming model for processing large data sets using a whole bunch of processors (you are supposed to start thinking of EC2 at this point).

          <p>Its time to clean out the inbox again. Heres what I have this afternoon: Carson Mcdonald wrote about Creating Your Own FC6 Instance for EC2. The article is very detailed and should be helpful. Redmonk analyst Steve OGrady was kind enough to bestow his first-ever Tecosystems Award for Technical Innovation on us. This was the [...]</p>
