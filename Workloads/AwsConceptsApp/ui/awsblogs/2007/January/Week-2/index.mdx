          <p>It&#8217;s gratifying to see third-party projects that interface with Amazon Web Services. For example, you can download a Perl Interface to Amazon EC2 from Jeff Kim on CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network), released on December 28th. Check it out at search.cpan.org/~jkim/Net-Amazon-EC2-0.02. &#8212; Mike Update: Title of post changed from PHP to Perl!</p>

          <p>Last last year I announced that an unnamed company was conducting a live seminar in the Seattle area and that they were holding some spaces open for AWS developers. I was able to attend that session, and can report that I saw some really, really cool development tools. In the space of the day I [...]</p>

          <p>There are some really interesting Mechanical Turk HITs available right now. Using a Flash application which is actually embedded in the body of the HIT, workers tag a sequential series of images to denote the presence of certain road features &#8212; yellow lines, manholes, drains, bollards, and pedestrian crossings.

          <p>I blogged about Hadoop on EC2 late last year. In a nutshell, Hadoop is an open source implementation of Google&#8217;s MapReduce algorithm. MapReduce is a simple and efficient programming model for processing large data sets using a whole bunch of processors (you are supposed to start thinking of EC2 at this point).

          <p>Its time to clean out the inbox again. Here&#8217;s what I have this afternoon: Carson Mcdonald wrote about Creating Your Own FC6 Instance for EC2. The article is very detailed and should be helpful. Redmonk analyst Steve O&#8217;Grady was kind enough to bestow his first-ever Tecosystems Award for Technical Innovation on us.
