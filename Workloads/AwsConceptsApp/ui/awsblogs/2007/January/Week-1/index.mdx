          <p>I received a call for help via LinkedIn early this morning: How can I find a developer familiar with Amazons API for a mashup Im planning? We dont have a formal way to make these connections right now, but the answers to this question are certainly interesting and thought-provoking. Among other things, weve thought about [...]</p>

          <p>I was lucky enough to receive an invitation to present at the first-ever meeting of Ignite Seattle this past December. This event attracted lots of Seattle-area technical folks for an evening that was both fun and informative.

          <p>In the course of searching for some links to flesh out my previous entry, I ran into something new and very cool the S3InfiDisk for EC2. The InfiDisk takes the form of a mountable Linux file system, creating an infinite storage disk for EC2 instances. The file systems can be mounted on any running EC2 [...]</p>
