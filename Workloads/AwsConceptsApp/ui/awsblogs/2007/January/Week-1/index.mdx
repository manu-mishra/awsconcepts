          <p>Welcome to 2007 everyone. I&#8217;ve got all kinds of cool stuff queued up in my inbox. Let&#8217;s start out with a couple of mashup notes. First, long-time AWS developer Francis Shanahan&#8216;s new book, Amazon Mashups, is now shipping. Weighing in at a hefty 408 pages, the book will show you how to combine Amazon data [...]</p>

          <p>I received a call for help via LinkedIn early this morning: How can I find a developer familiar with Amazon&#8217;s API for a mashup I&#8217;m planning? We don&#8217;t have a formal way to make these connections right now, but the answers to this question are certainly interesting and thought-provoking. Among other things, we&#8217;ve thought about [...]</p>

          <p>I was lucky enough to receive an invitation to present at the first-ever meeting of Ignite Seattle this past December. This event attracted lots of Seattle-area technical folks for an evening that was both fun and informative. We started out the evening by forming into teams to build bridges from popsicle sticks and hot glue. [...]</p>

          <p>In the course of searching for some links to flesh out my previous entry, I ran into something new and very cool the S3InfiDisk for EC2. The InfiDisk takes the form of a mountable Linux file system, creating an infinite storage disk for EC2 instances. The file systems can be mounted on any running EC2 [...]</p>
