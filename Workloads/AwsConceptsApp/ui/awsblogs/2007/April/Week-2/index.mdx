          <p>In this age of speed where Electric Cars go 0 to 60 in 4 seconds, I found the fastest way to get started with Amazon EC2 : . With the new Firefox Plugin : EC2UI Firefox lovers will love it. It takes less than 4 seconds to download and install (unless you are running at [...]</p>

          <p>We were sitting around the office the other day, munching on some M&amp;Ms and lamenting the fact that we had to actually go and check the various AWS Forums each day in order to stay abreast of the newest releases of each product.

          <p>The Enomalism Amazon EC2 Migration Module supports bi-directional migration of virtual machine images to and from Amazon EC2. In other words, you can easily and transparently move running images back and forth between your local Xen-based computing environment and Amazon EC2.
