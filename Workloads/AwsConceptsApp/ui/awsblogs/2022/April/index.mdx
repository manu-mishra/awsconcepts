          <p>Latin America is set to achieve gender parity in 69 years, according to the latest World Economic Forum (WEF)s Global Gender Gap Report. The same report shows that women experience a bigger gender gap in fast-growing fields like cloud computing, where women represent 25% or below of the workforce. At AWS, we believe that to address this challenge, we must give individuals around the world, from all backgrounds, the opportunity to develop cloud skills and begin promising careers in technology.

          <p>Somatic variants are genetic alterations which are not inherited but acquired during ones lifespan, for example those that are present in cancer tumors. In this post, we will demonstrate how to perform somatic variant calling from matched tumor and normal genome sequence data, as well as tumor-only whole genome and whole exome datasets using an NVIDIA GPU-accelerated Parabricks pipeline, and compare the results with baseline CPU-based workflows.</p>

          <p>Idempotency is a critical piece of serverless architectures and can be difficult to implement. If not done correctly, it can lead to inconsistent data and other issues. This post shows how you can use Lambda Powertools to make Lambda functions idempotent and ensure that critical transactions are handled only once.</p>

          <p>Geospatial datasets are increasingly large, reaching terabyte and even petabyte scale, which can cause many challenges for geospatial analysts and educatorsbut Amazon AppStream 2.0 can provide some solutions. In this blog post, we walk through how to deploy QGIS, a no cost, open-source geospatial information system (GIS) application used by geospatial analysts, in Amazon AppStream 2.0. We also load an example dataset to demonstrate how desktop GIS application users can access large, cloud-hosted geospatial datasets with high performance by keeping the data and compute components together on the cloud, and streaming the desktop application instead of downloading the data itself.</p>
