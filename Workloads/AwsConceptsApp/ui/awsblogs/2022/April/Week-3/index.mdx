          <p>Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a commonly used machine learning (ML) technology in our daily lives and business scenarios. Applications such as voice-controlled assistants like Alexa and Siri, and voice-to-text applications like automatic subtitling for videos and transcribing meetings, are all powered by this technology. These applications take audio clips as input and convert speech [...]</p>

          <p>Geospatial datasets are increasingly large, reaching terabyte and even petabyte scale, which can cause many challenges for geospatial analysts and educators-but Amazon AppStream 2.0 can provide some solutions. In this blog post, we walk through how to deploy QGIS, a no cost, open-source geospatial information system (GIS) application used by geospatial analysts, in Amazon AppStream 2.0. We also load an example dataset to demonstrate how desktop GIS application users can access large, cloud-hosted geospatial datasets with high performance by keeping the data and compute components together on the cloud, and streaming the desktop application instead of downloading the data itself.</p>

          <p>Many SaaS providers are leveraging Amazon EKS to build their solutions on AWS, as EKS provides builders with a range of different constructs that can be used to implement multi-tenant strategies. In this post, explore an architecture based on EKS that demonstrates a siloed SaaS deployment model, using Istio Service Mesh to manage request authentication and per-tenant routing. Istio is an open-source service mesh that many SaaS providers use for deploying their multi-tenant applications.</p>
