          <p>Latin America is set to achieve gender parity in 69 years, according to the latest World Economic Forum (WEF)s Global Gender Gap Report. The same report shows that women experience a bigger gender gap in fast-growing fields like cloud computing, where women represent 25% or below of the workforce. At AWS, we believe that to address this challenge, we must give individuals around the world, from all backgrounds, the opportunity to develop cloud skills and begin promising careers in technology.
