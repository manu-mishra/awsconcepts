          <p>Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source general-purpose policy engine, licensed under the Apache License 2.0, that allows you to decouple policy decision-making from application code. OPA assists organizations in effectively implementing policy as code. It allows policy to be expressed through a high-level declarative language (Rego), and it also allows policy authoring to [...]</p>

          <p>Proteins are large biomolecules that play an important role in the body. Knowing the physical structure of proteins is key to understanding their function. However, it can be difficult and expensive to determine the structure of many proteins experimentally. One alternative is to predict these structures using machine learning algorithms. Several high-profile research teams have [...]</p>
