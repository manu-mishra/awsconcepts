          <p>A research team led by Dr. Beatriz Martinez Lopez at UC Davis supports pig farmers with a data analytics platform that aggregates and analyzes animal health data to diagnose animal viruses and diseases. But this platform was primarily designed for analysts and data scientists. To truly transform animal disease management, Martinez-Lopez wants to put this data analytics tool into the hands of farmers around the world. So the research team is using the scalable, cost-effective tools of the AWS Cloud, along with a research grant letter of support from AWS, to make this optimized platform a reality.</p>
