          <p>Matt Rasmussen, VP of Software Engineering at insitro describes their recently released, open-source data science framework, redun, which allows data scientists to define complex scientific workflows that scale from their laptop to large-scale distributed runs on serverless platforms likeAWS BatchandAWS Glue. I this post, Matt shows how redun lends itself to Bioinformatics workflows which typically involve wrapping Unix-based programs that require file staging to and from object storage. In thenext blog post, Matt describes how redun scales to large and heterogenous workflows by leveraging AWS Batch features such as Array Jobs and AWS Glue features such as Glue DynamicFrame.</p>

The NCSC provides security guidance for protecting government systems, planning for cyber incidents, and more. In this post, we cover how you can configure AWS serviceslike AWS DataSync, AWS Storage Gateway, and AWS Transfer Familyto align your data transfer solution with the NCSCs cloud security principles, as understanding these configurations is important to protect data and meet requirements for local force accreditation.</p>
