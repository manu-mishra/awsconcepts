          <p>When managing your contact center, call quality has a significant impact on the customer experience. If your agents take calls on Amazon Connect using the softphone over the internet, the audio quality is typically high. However, changes in networking conditions can result in varying audio quality from factors such as increased latency or packet loss.
By capturing and storing real-time call metrics, you can proactively monitor call quality. In this blog, we describe a solution which captures real-time metrics from the Amazon Connect softphone, creates easily understandable dashboards from the metrics, and makes this data searchable for further analysis.
The dashboards give your contact center supervisors and operators insights into the customer experience from both a business and operational lens. They can help you answer questions like how many calls are abnormally short, how many calls experience poor audio quality, and other common operational questions. This allows your business to take actions to improve the customer experience.</p>

          <p>Much of the hardware used on the factory floor today has been in place for many years, and managing these devices from the internet often requires replacement of the hardware. Utilizing AWS IoT Greengrass and AWS Lambda functions allow legacy hardware to be maintained, while providing full internet connectivity and management. This post shows how 42Q, an AWS Industrial Software Competency Partner, uses AWS IoT Greengrass to allow legacy label printers to be cloud-enabled.</p>
