          <p>Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. When we use infrastructure as code (IaC) we want to describe workloads wholistically, and that includes the configuration of firewalls alongside the entrypoints to web applications. As we evolve the infrastructure that our application is built upon, we can adjust firewall rules in the same [...]</p>

          <p>Organizing, forecasting, and understanding the costs of your disaster recovery (DR) solution is an important part of DR cost optimization and management. Without a breakdown of resource costs, these tasks can be challenging. Allocating tags to resources is a useful strategy to identify and group resources for cost estimation. However, this manual effort becomes more [...]</p>
