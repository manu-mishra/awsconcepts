          <p>You can use Lambda functions to handle fully managed asynchronous processing of SQS messages. Estimating the cost and optimal setup depends on leveraging the various configurations of SQS and Lambda functions. The cost estimator tool presented in this blog should help you understand these configurations and their impact on the overall cost and performance of the Lambda function-based messaging solutions.</p>

          <p>Are your infrastructure as code (IaC) Terraform deployments on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud protected against drift? IaC drift, which can leave your data and resources exposed to security risks, is especially difficult to track down and remove in an environment that spans multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions. You can do it though, and in this post we show you how.</p>
