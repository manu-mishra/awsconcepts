          <p>A key part of the development of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms is simulation using existing classical architectures and HPC techniques. In this blog post, we describe how to perform large-scale quantum circuits simulations using AWS ParallelCluster with QuEST, the Quantum Exact Simulation Toolkit. We demonstrate a simple and rapid deployment of computational resources up to 4,096 compute instances to simulate random quantum circuits with up to 44 qubits. We were able to allocate as many as 4096 EC2 instances of c5.18xlarge to simulate a non-trivial 44 qubit quantum circuit in fewer than 3.5 hours.</p>

          <p>Predictive models have powered the design and analysis of real-world systems such as jet engines, automobiles, and powerplants for decades. These models are used to provide insights on system performance and to run simulations, at a fraction of the cost compared to experiments with physical hardware. In this first post of three, we described the motivation and general architecture of the open-source aws-do-pm framework project for building predictive models at scale in AWS.</p>

          <p>You can use Lambda functions to handle fully managed asynchronous processing of SQS messages. Estimating the cost and optimal setup depends on leveraging the various configurations of SQS and Lambda functions. The cost estimator tool presented in this blog should help you understand these configurations and their impact on the overall cost and performance of the Lambda function-based messaging solutions.</p>

IaC drift, which can leave your data and resources exposed to security risks, is especially difficult to track down and remove in an environment that spans multiple AWS accounts and AWS Regions. You can do it though, and in this post we show you how.</p>
