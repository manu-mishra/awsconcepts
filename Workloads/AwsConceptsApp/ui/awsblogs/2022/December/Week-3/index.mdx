          <p>Customers commonly begin their journey to AWS by rehosting (lifting-and-shifting) servers in their on-premises environment. They do this for various business reasons, including shifting from capital to operational expense, reducing total cost of ownership, reducing support costs, data center exit, and many others. AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is the automated lift-and-shift service that facilitates [...]</p>

          <p>As companies adopt a cloud-first strategy, ITOps and DevOps require a single view of application services and infrastructure so they can be equipped with the right observability solution. Observability lets you determine what&#8217;s important by watching how the system performs over time, and ask new questions using metrics, logs, or traces. Tech Mahindra&#8217;s smart monitoring and resolution tool is called SMART and is built on top of AWS observability and telemetry tools.</p>

          <p>The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), commonly referred to as the Infrastructure Bill, allocates over $350 billion in funding for major projects in the United States. As they consider where to allocate these funds, public infrastructure owners, especially Department of Transportation (DOT) and public works agencies, have to assess the condition of their assets, determine what to prioritize while rebuilding, and identify what needs maintenance. Learn about key benefits for agencies from using cloud-based asset management software.</p>
