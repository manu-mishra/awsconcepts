          <p>In 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announced the creation of the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract&#8212;a multi-vendor acquisition vehicle designed to make cloud services and capabilities available at all classi&#64257;cation levels and across all security domains, from the enterprise to the tactical edge. JWCC will enable the DoD to fully leverage the capabilities of the cloud to meet current and future mission initiatives. Further, JWCC is key to enabling critical warfighter capabilities, such as the Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2), and the DoD Artificial Intelligence and Data Acceleration Initiative (ADA). As the DoD continues to modernize the way it supports the warfighter and defends our national security, AWS is committed to supporting its critical mission.</p>
