          <p>Many enterprises use frameworks such as &#8220;The 7 R&#8217;s&#8221; to formulate their migration strategy and approach when embarking on a large-scale cloud migration. These frameworks are great at conceptually capturing &#8220;how&#8221; to migrate applications (e.g., rehost vs. refactor), but they don&#8217;t take into account &#8220;what&#8221; the target state post-migration should look like or help you [...]</p>

          <p>Stable Diffusion is a state-of-the-art text-to-image model that generates images from text. Deploying text-to-image models such as Stable Diffusion can be difficult. Currently, Stable Diffusion requires specific computer hardware known as graphical processing units (GPUs). You can lower the bar to entry by offloading the text-to-image generation onto Amazon Web Services (AWS). Discord is a [...]</p>
