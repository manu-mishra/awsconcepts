          <p>The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), commonly referred to as the Infrastructure Bill, allocates over $350 billion in funding for major projects in the United States. As they consider where to allocate these funds, public infrastructure owners, especially Department of Transportation (DOT) and public works agencies, have to assess the condition of their assets, determine what to prioritize while rebuilding, and identify what needs maintenance. Learn about key benefits for agencies from using cloud-based asset management software.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, US President Joe Biden set a goal to end cancer as we know it by improving prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. To answer this call, AWS is expanding its ongoing work with the Childrens Brain Tumor Network (CBTN). Together, AWS and the CBTN will enable researchers and clinicians to share and analyze medical record, imaging, genomic, and other data in near real-time to speed development of new therapies for pediatric brain cancers.</p>

AWS Partner Booz Allen performed the migration and used the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) and AWS Snow Family of devices as mechanisms to help the customer save time, reduce costs, and increase their agility to develop new features for their constituents.</p>
