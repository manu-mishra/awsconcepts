          <p>The intersection of DI and AI: Drug information refers to the discovery, use, and management of healthcare and medical information. Healthcare providers have many challenges associated with drug information discovery, such as intensive time involvement, lack of accessibility, and accuracy of reliable data. The average clinical query requires a literature search that takes an average of 18.5 hours. In addition, drug information often lies in disparate information silos, behind pay walls and design walls, and quickly becomes stale.</p>

          <p>Numerous legacy workloads, still hosted on premises, are mission-critical and hardly interruptible. Their migration to AWS must happen quasi-transparently for their users. This post details how the combination of AWS Outposts and CloudEndure can be used to solve for this issue. We demonstrate this by migrating a Solaris machine making use of the Charon SSP emulator by Stromasys, running on standard Amazon EC2 instances and using CloudEndure.</p>

          <p>The Met Office is the UKs National Meteorological Service, providing 247 world-renowned scientific excellence in weather, climate and environmental forecasts and severe weather warnings for the protection of life and property. They provide forecasts and guidance for the public, to our government and defence colleagues as well as the private sector. As an example, if youve been on a plane over Europe, Middle East, or Africa; that plane took off because the Met Office (as one of two World Aviation Forecast Centres) provided a forecast. This article explains one of the ways they use AWS to collect these observations, which has freed them to focus more on top quality delivery for their customers.</p>
