          <p>To mitigate synthetic fraud, government agencies should consider complementing their rules-based improper payment detection systems with machine learning (ML) techniques. By using ML on a large number of disparate but related data sources, including social media, agencies can formulate a more comprehensive risk score for each individual or transaction to help investigators identify improper payments efficiently. In this blog post, we provide a foundational reference architecture for an ML-powered improper payment detection solution using AWS ML services.</p>

          <p>Enterprises frequently begin their journey by re-hosting (lift-and-shift) their on-premises workloads into AWS and running Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. A simpler way to re-host is by using AWS Application Migration Service (Application Migration Service), a cloud-native migration service. To streamline and expedite migrations, automate reusable migration patterns that work for a wide [...]</p>

          <p>Recently, the National Science Foundation (NSF) announced a new funding opportunity for any principal investigator (PI) with an active award from the NSF Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), for use of cloud services and technologies via CloudBank. PIs can submit requests for use of the AWS Cloud, on a rolling basis, with funding made available for the duration of one year. This is a first-of-its-kind opportunity for federally-funded researchers to explore the capabilities of the AWS Cloud, at no additional cost.</p>
