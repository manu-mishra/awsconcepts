          <p>One of the biggest advantages of VMware Cloud on AWS is that it can readily integrate with other AWS services. That gives you countless ways to elevate your workloads. If you’re amassing data in your databases over time and are looking for novel ways to glean fresh insights out of it, using Amazon Redshift and Amazon QuickSight is an easy and accessible way to achieve it. This post describes how to get more out of existing data residing inside your databases running in VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>

          <p>Higher education faces a complex set of challenges as it emerges from the pandemic years. Leaders find they must think differently about supporting students through their educational journeys, personalizing the learning experience, offering more flexibility in learning modality, and better supporting students, including attending to mental health. At the core of this transformation is data. Learn more about the higher education journey to effectively utilizing data, then learn how to build a cloud data strategy in the eBook The Data-Informed Institution.</p>

However, creating and managing the lifecycle of IAM users in AWS can be time-consuming. This post explores how to authenticate users against Azure AD for access to one or multiple AWS accounts using SAML federation. Additionally, it includes a walkthrough on how to setup the federation across Azure AD and multiple AWS accounts.</p>

          <p>Edge computing moves data processing and analysis close to endpoints where data is generated to deliver real-time responsiveness, and reduces cost associated with transferring large amounts of data. Edge environments include Internet of Things (IoT) or mobile devices, sensors, video cameras, and other connected resources. With edge, the usual security principles still apply such as protecting data at rest and in motion, but new considerations emerge. Learn more in the new IDC whitepaper.</p>
