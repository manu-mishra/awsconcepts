          <p>Today, we’re excited to announce that Amazon Forecast offers the ability to generate forecasts on a selected subset of items. This helps you to leverage the full value of your data, and apply it selectively on your choice of items reducing the time and effort to get forecasted results. Generating a forecast on ‘all’ items of the [...]</p>

          <p>One of the design principles to build reliable workloads is to test your recovery procedures. While this is a challenging task in traditional environments (i.e., on-premises), it’s much easier on the cloud because you can predict how your application fails and simulate a failure. You can then validate how your people, technology, and processes work [...]</p>

          <p>Having a disaster recovery (DR) strategy is an essential part of business continuity and is an important part of designing your workload for resilience. Resilience means that your application, and its supporting infrastructure, always performs its intended functions correctly and consistently over time. In some cases, customers who host their primary workloads on the cloud [...]</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are critical tools being used in healthcare research, autonomous applications, predictive maintenance, and also a key tool used to advance sustainability solutions. However, to use AI and ML to solve sustainability problems, innovators need specific datasets that are prepared for analysis and training of the models. To help create and accelerate sustainability solutions, the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) today announced easier identification of sustainability datasets with integration in AWS Data Exchange and the launch of a sustainability hackathon.</p>
