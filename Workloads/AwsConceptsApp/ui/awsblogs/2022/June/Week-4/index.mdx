          <p>One of the design principles to build reliable workloads is to test your recovery procedures. While this is a challenging task in traditional environments (i.e., on-premises), its much easier on the cloud because you can predict how your application fails and simulate a failure. You can then validate how your people, technology, and processes work [...]</p>

          <p>Having a disaster recovery (DR) strategy is an essential part of business continuity and is an important part of designing your workload for resilience. Resilience means that your application, and its supporting infrastructure, always performs its intended functions correctly and consistently over time. In some cases, customers who host their primary workloads on the cloud [...]</p>

          <p>King Hamad University Hospital (KHUH) and Bahrain Oncology Center is a 600-bed-hospital in Bahrain. Over the years, KHUH faced constraints with exponential growth of their on-premise storage needs, particularly with the medical images stored by their picture archiving and communication system (PACS). KHUH turned to AWS to develop a cost- and time-effective long-term storage solution, without making changes to their existing PACS, that reduced storage costs by 40%.</p>
