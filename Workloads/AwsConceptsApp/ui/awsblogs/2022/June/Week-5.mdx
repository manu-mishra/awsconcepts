For smaller NLP datasets, a simple yet effective strategy is to use a pre-trained transformer, usually trained in an unsupervised fashion on very large datasets, and fine-tune [...]</p>

          <p>Higher education faces a complex set of challenges as it emerges from the pandemic years. Leaders find they must think differently about supporting students through their educational journeys, personalizing the learning experience, offering more flexibility in learning modality, and better supporting students, including attending to mental health. At the core of this transformation is data. Learn more about the higher education journey to effectively utilizing data, then learn how to build a cloud data strategy in the eBook The Data-Informed Institution.</p>

          <p>With AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS provides a central way to manage user identities and permissions. However, creating and managing the lifecycle of IAM users in AWS can be time-consuming. This post explores how to authenticate users against Azure AD for access to one or multiple AWS accounts using SAML federation. Additionally, it includes a walkthrough on how to setup the federation across Azure AD and multiple AWS accounts.</p>

          <p>Edge computing moves data processing and analysis close to endpoints where data is generated to deliver real-time responsiveness, and reduces cost associated with transferring large amounts of data. Edge environments include Internet of Things (IoT) or mobile devices, sensors, video cameras, and other connected resources. With edge, the usual security principles still apply such as protecting data at rest and in motion, but new considerations emerge. Learn more in the new IDC whitepaper.</p>
