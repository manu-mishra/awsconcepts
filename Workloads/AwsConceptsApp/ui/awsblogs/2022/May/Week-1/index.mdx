          <p>Nursing shortages are not a new phenomenon, but the pandemic has exacerbated the problem. The situation has forced hospitals to think creatively about their staffing models and has also brought clinical teams, operators, and IT departments together in an effort to seek new ways to use technology. One healthcare system is using robotics powered by cloud technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to help nurses spend more time with patients.</p>
