          <p>It takes a medical village to discover and diagnose rare diseases. The National Institutes of Healths Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) is made up of a coordinating center, 12 clinical sites, a model organism screening center, a metabolomics core, a sequencing core, and a biorepository. For many years prior to the UDN, the experts at these sites were limited by antiquated data-sharing procedures. The UDN leadership realized that if they wanted to scale up and serve as many patients as possible, they needed to transform how they process, store, and share medical datawhich led the UDN to the AWS Cloud.</p>

          <p>Processing large amounts of complex data often requires leveraging a mix of different Amazon EC2 instance types. These types of computations also benefit from shared, high performance, scalable storage like Amazon FSx for Lustre. A way to save costs on your analysis is to use Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, which can help to reduce EC2 costs up to 90% compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. This post will guide you in the creation of a fault-tolerant cluster using AWS ParallelCluster. We will explain how to configure ParallelCluster to automatically unmount the Amazon FSx for Lustre filesystem and resubmit the interrupted jobs back into the queue in the case of Spot interruption events.</p>
