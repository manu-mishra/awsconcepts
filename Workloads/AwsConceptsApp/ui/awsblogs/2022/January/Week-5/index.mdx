          <p>How do we avoid the next global pandemic? For researchers collaborating with the University of British Columbia Cloud Innovation Center (UBC CIC), the answer to that question lies in a massive library of genetic sequencing data. But there is a problem: the data library is so massive that traditional computing can’t comprehensively analyze or process it. So the UBC CIC team collaborated with computational virologists to create Serratus, an open-science viral discovery platform to transform the field of genomics—built on the massive computational power of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.</p>

          <p>The AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program makes high-value, cloud-optimized datasets publicly available on AWS. We work with data providers to democratize access to data by making it available to the public for analysis on AWS; to develop new cloud-native techniques, formats, and tools that lower the cost of working with data; and to encourage the development of communities that benefit from access to shared datasets. This quarter, we released 19 new or updated datasets like validated OpenStreetMap data, bioacoustic data, COVID-19 detection data, and more.</p>
