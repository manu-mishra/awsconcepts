          <p>Even the most technically astute organizations can find it challenging to conform to such requirements and do so efficiently. The Authority to Operate (ATO) on AWS partner program supports Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers overcome these hurdles by building a community of vetted, expert partners. While the ATO on AWS program was originally launched in the United States, it has begun supporting customers globally and we are excited to formally launch the program in Canada.</p>

          <p>Many organizations record calls which are potential gold mines of rich insights about customer satisfaction, customer churn, competitive intelligence, service issues, agent performance, and campaign effectiveness. However, the sheer volume of phone calls exceeds a contact centers ability to review and analyze them in order to glean those valuable insights. Learn how SourceFuse used custom microservices development to design a call center solution for a healthcare customer.</p>

          <p>With the rise of voice assistants like Amazon Alexa, customer expectations for handling inquiries and transactions have shifted from the outdated phone keypad, also known as dual tone multi-frequency (DTMF), to modern conversational AI that enables machines to communicate with human beings. In this post, we demonstrate how Presidio implemented conversational AI to check the wait time and reserve a table at a restaurant using Amazon Chime SDK, Amazon Lex, and Amazon Polly.</p>

          <p>Modern enterprises are increasingly adopting microservice architectures and moving away from monolithic structures. Although microservices provide agility in development and scalability, and encourage use of polyglot systems, they also add complexity. Troubleshooting distributed services is hard because the application behavioral data is distributed across multiple machines. Therefore, in order to have deep insights to troubleshoot [...]</p>

          <p>In June 2022, AWS Partner Coursera launched the annual Global Skills Report, an in-depth look at the state of skills globally. The Global Skills Report draws data from 100 million learners in more than 100 countries who have used Coursera, a global online learning platform, to develop a new skill during the past year. Building on the findings from the Global Skills Report, the following are four skills trends that workforce development leaders, like those in state and local government and education, should keep in mind as they strive to build an inclusive and competitive workforce.</p>

          <p>Many public sector customers in government, healthcare, and life sciences have data lakes that contain addresses (e.g., 123 Main Street). These customers frequently ask how they can quickly visualize these addresses on a geographic map to get a more intuitive understanding of how these addresses are distributed. In this post, learn how to use Amazon Athena and Amazon Location Service to perform ad hoc geocoding on an example dataset and visualize these geocoded addresses on an Amazon QuickSight map.</p>
