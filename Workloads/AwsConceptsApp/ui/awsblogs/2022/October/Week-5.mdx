          <p>This post explores an asynchronous pattern for ingesting data from legacy systems, collecting it into projections, and aggregating it into single views. The purpose of this solution is to decouple the source systems where data is stored from the external channels that request dataensuring both offloading of source systems and making data available to channels 24/7 and in near real-time. The proposed solution is a simplification of the high-end architecture of Mia-Platform Fast Data.</p>
