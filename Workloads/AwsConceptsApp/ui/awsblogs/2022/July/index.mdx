          <p>At the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (BCM HGSC), we aim to advance precision medicine and research in genomics. In that effort, we joined the ambitious All of Us Research Program funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to help deliver genomic data to over one million individuals across the United States. In early 2019, we estimated that processing whole genome samples for this megaproject would imply a scale-up of over four times the production workload of our center. We used AWS to support our new pipeline demands, which saved time, reduced costs, and created new opportunities for future development.</p>

          <p>Carbyne, an AWS justice and public safety customer and partner, provides 911 call handling systems, offering a cloud-native software as a service (SaaS) platform. Although any public safety answering points (PSAPs) can benefit from Carbynes cloud-powered solution, certain regions with hostile, remote terrain can especially benefit from improved caller location and the ability to put eyes on the scene. This is crucial, for example, in situations where people are lost or hurt in the desert, and in desert-heavy counties that form the Rio Grande Council of Governments (RGCOG). Using Carbyne improved RioCOGs caller location from an accuracy of a few miles to within roughly 10 meters on over 85% of emergency calls.</p>

          <p>In July 2021, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) released a cloud native access point (CNAP) reference design that follows zero trust architecture (ZTA) principles and provides a new approach to access mission owner (MO) applications. The DoDs reference design discusses four core capabilities of CNAP: authenticated and authorized entities (C1), authorized ingress (C2), authorized egress (C3), and security monitoring and compliance enforcement (C4). In this blog post, we walk through how to establish the C2 component via a virtual internet access point (vIAP) with AWS. The proposed architectures can reduce operational cost and management overhead, while improving the accessibility, resiliency, and security of mission owner applications.</p>

          <p>AWS Transfer Family provides SFTP, FTPS, and/or FTP access to Amazon S3 or Amazon Amazon EFS. It does that by providing a secure, highly available, and scalable server endpoint. You pay for the time this endpoint is enabled, and for data transfer (upload and download). Learn how this makes a multi-tenant setup where an endpoint is shared between different users (or applications), a more cost-efficient solution than having dedicated endpoints.</p>
