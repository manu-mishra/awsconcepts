          <p>AWS Transfer Family provides SFTP, FTPS, and/or FTP access to Amazon S3 or Amazon Amazon EFS. It does that by providing a secure, highly available, and scalable server endpoint. You pay for the time this endpoint is enabled, and for data transfer (upload and download). Learn how this makes a multi-tenant setup where an endpoint is shared between different users (or applications), a more cost-efficient solution than having dedicated endpoints.</p>

          <p>Deploying machine learning (ML) models as a packaged container with hardware-optimized acceleration, without compromising accuracy and while being financially feasible, can be challenging. As machine learning models become the brains of modern applications, developers need a simpler way to deploy trained ML models to live endpoints for inference. This post explores how a ML engineer can take a trained model, optimize and containerize the model using OctoML CLI, and deploy it to Amazon EKS.</p>
