          <p>To assist the science community in conducting studies of climate change impacts at local to regional scales, NASA created the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP) dataset, or NEX-GDDP-CMIP6. This dataset is expected to enhance public understanding of possible future climate patterns at the spatial scale of individual towns, cities, and watersheds. It provides a set of global, high resolution, bias-corrected climate change projections that can be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are sensitive to finer-scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography on climate conditions. As part of the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), this dataset is available at no cost on the Registry of Open Data.</p>

          <p>By using Serverless on AWS to scale their infrastructure, the cinch team was able to focus their cognitive load on improving the platform, quickly release new features, and re-build existing ones based on real world customer insight. With their new architecture, cinch was able to pivot their business to the new model in 6 months, increase traffic by 2.5x (6,000 to 16,000 requests per minute), and reduce latency. They went from hundreds of cars sold within days, and grew by a factor of 100x within a few weeks.</p>

          <p>Its almost the most wonderful time of the year again: AWS re:Invent is just around the corner. And while wed love to hang out with you in Las Vegas from November 28 through December 2, never fear if you cant attend in person. You can still get everything re:Invent has to offer by attending virtually. (Well, except for the slot machines and general Vegas-fueled sensory overload, of course!)</p>

          <p>According to the United States Constitution, public access to judicial proceedings is a right covered by the First and Sixth Amendments. To make hearings visible to the public, even when in-person attendance is limited, state and local governments are beginning to mandate many court proceedings be live streamed, often with a very short window to do so. The cloud-native media and asset management platform Nomad, which is built on AWS, helps governments implement scalable live streaming capabilities quickly and simply.</p>
