          <p>As one-time donations increasingly become the norm, nonprofit development teams are challenged to think outside-the-box to attract, retain, and communicate with their valuable supporters. Nonprofit organizations can use data to inform an enhanced engagement strategy, but many are challenged to unlock the full value of that data affordably and at scale. To help nonprofits use the cloud to build innovative fundraising and member engagement solutions, we are launching a new program AWS TechAction.</p>

Considering the sensitivity of the Aadhaar number and the potential implication of having ones Aadhaar number compromised, UIDAI mandated the need for all Aadhaar and Aadhaar-related data to be encrypted and stored separately in a secure, access-controlled data repository known as an Aadhaar Data Vault. This blog post explains how government and private entities that collect, process, and store Aadhaar data for various use cases can use AWS CloudHSM from AWS to create an Aadhaar data storage solution that can meet guidelines provided by UIDAI.</p>

          <p>To gain operational efficiencies and reduce workload burdens on employees, some state finance and tax agencies are leveraging robotic process automation (RPA) on AWS. RPA is a software tool that integrates with almost any system or application and performs manual, repetitive, time-consuming tasks. Tax agencies can use AI and ML to support the sheer size and scale of data they manage and to access and analyze all types of data with ease, including voice, video, and streaming data. Find out three ways AI and ML are creating measurable outcomes for tax agencies.</p>

          <p>Though their personal experiences in the lab were different, Sara and Gabriel, PhD student, came to the same conclusion: research labs are seriously lacking when it comes to accessibility. Its a pervasive problem not limited to one institution or type of disability. Thats why they decided to collaborate with LabVoicea digital lab assistant platform designed specifically for the research lab. Working together with the LabVoice team, they developed an inventory search solution that allows users to record information, like chemical location and amount, and then retrieve it later entirely through verbal prompts.</p>

          <p>Natural disasters are devastating, often resulting in loss of life, massive property damage, and damage to the critical infrastructure that powers emergency services. This can prompt public sector organizations to consider building more resilient infrastructure. Such was the case for the 911 system in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, an agency that dispatches for 21 public safety agencies including law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services, and averages over 325 calls for service per day. After a major flood in 2016 knocked out their 911 system, they worked with AWS Partner TailorBuilt Solutions, LLC. to use AWS to become resilient against disaster, reducing service interruptions and improving response times.</p>

          <p>Originally, Fyles Data-Extractor service relied on an external service provider for optical character recognition (OCR) and Fyles internal machine learning algorithm to detect amount, category, date, currency, and vendor information. Unfortunately, they were receiving some feedback from customers that their tool wasnt very accurate. As you can imagine, this isnt the best place to be, so they rewrote their Data-Extractor service to use Amazon Textract because of its intuitive web console for APIs, which allowed them to test APIs in real-time with personalized input. This let them quickly try out an Amazon Textract API, which helped them achieve their goal of turning around a solution in two months. After implementing their new solution, Fyle saw 51.7% improvement in accuracy for the Data-Extractor service.</p>

          <p>Diabetes is a major chronic disease that often results in hospital readmissions due to multiple factors. An estimated $25 billion is spent on preventable hospital readmissions that result from medical errors and complications, poor discharge procedures, and lack of integrated follow-up care. If hospitals can predict diabetic patient readmission, medical practitioners can provide additional and personalized care to their patients to pre-empt this possible readmission, thus possibly saving cost, time, and human life. In this blog post, learn how to use machine learning (ML) from AWS to create a solution that can predict hospital readmission in this case, of diabetic patients based on multiple data inputs.</p>

          <p>To assist the science community in conducting studies of climate change impacts at local to regional scales, NASA created the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP) dataset, or NEX-GDDP-CMIP6. This dataset is expected to enhance public understanding of possible future climate patterns at the spatial scale of individual towns, cities, and watersheds. It provides a set of global, high resolution, bias-corrected climate change projections that can be used to evaluate climate change impacts on processes that are sensitive to finer-scale climate gradients and the effects of local topography on climate conditions. As part of the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI), this dataset is available at no cost on the Registry of Open Data.</p>

          <p>By using Serverless on AWS to scale their infrastructure, the cinch team was able to focus their cognitive load on improving the platform, quickly release new features, and re-build existing ones based on real world customer insight. With their new architecture, cinch was able to pivot their business to the new model in 6 months, increase traffic by 2.5x (6,000 to 16,000 requests per minute), and reduce latency. They went from hundreds of cars sold within days, and grew by a factor of 100x within a few weeks.</p>
