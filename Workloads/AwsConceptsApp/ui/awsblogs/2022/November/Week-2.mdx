          <p>Originally, Fyles Data-Extractor service relied on an external service provider for optical character recognition (OCR) and Fyles internal machine learning algorithm to detect amount, category, date, currency, and vendor information. Unfortunately, they were receiving some feedback from customers that their tool wasnt very accurate. As you can imagine, this isnt the best place to be, so they rewrote their Data-Extractor service to use Amazon Textract because of its intuitive web console for APIs, which allowed them to test APIs in real-time with personalized input. This let them quickly try out an Amazon Textract API, which helped them achieve their goal of turning around a solution in two months. After implementing their new solution, Fyle saw 51.7% improvement in accuracy for the Data-Extractor service.</p>

          <p>Diabetes is a major chronic disease that often results in hospital readmissions due to multiple factors. An estimated $25 billion is spent on preventable hospital readmissions that result from medical errors and complications, poor discharge procedures, and lack of integrated follow-up care. If hospitals can predict diabetic patient readmission, medical practitioners can provide additional and personalized care to their patients to pre-empt this possible readmission, thus possibly saving cost, time, and human life. In this blog post, learn how to use machine learning (ML) from AWS to create a solution that can predict hospital readmission in this case, of diabetic patients based on multiple data inputs.</p>
