          <p>What do you do if you don’t have the resources, time, or funds to self-manage a database? Use Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)! Amazon RDS allows you to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud with just a few clicks. It removes inefficient and time-consuming database administrative tasks without needing to provision infrastructure or maintain software. And, with the new AWS Database Plug &amp; Play Program, you’ll get a packaged bundle of AWS advisory time, architecture and prototyping patterns, AWS usage credits, and pathways to go-to-market acceleration programs to help further ensure your teams can focus on value-generating work.</p>

          <p>Originally, Fyle&#8217;s Data-Extractor service relied on an external service provider for optical character recognition (OCR) and Fyle’s internal machine learning algorithm to detect amount, category, date, currency, and vendor information. Unfortunately, they were receiving some feedback from customers that their tool wasn’t very accurate. As you can imagine, this isn’t the best place to be, so they rewrote their Data-Extractor service to use Amazon Textract because of its intuitive web console for APIs, which allowed them to test APIs in real-time with personalized input. This let them quickly try out an Amazon Textract API, which helped them achieve their goal of turning around a solution in two months. After implementing their new solution, Fyle saw 51.7% improvement in accuracy for the Data-Extractor service.</p>

          <p>Diabetes is a major chronic disease that often results in hospital readmissions due to multiple factors. An estimated $25 billion is spent on preventable hospital readmissions that result from medical errors and complications, poor discharge procedures, and lack of integrated follow-up care. If hospitals can predict diabetic patient readmission, medical practitioners can provide additional and personalized care to their patients to pre-empt this possible readmission, thus possibly saving cost, time, and human life. In this blog post, learn how to use machine learning (ML) from AWS to create a solution that can predict hospital readmission – in this case, of diabetic patients – based on multiple data inputs.</p>
