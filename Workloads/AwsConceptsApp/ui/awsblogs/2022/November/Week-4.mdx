          <p>An Aadhaar number is a 12-digit unique identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to every individual in India. Considering the sensitivity of the Aadhaar number and the potential implication of having ones Aadhaar number compromised, UIDAI mandated the need for all Aadhaar and Aadhaar-related data to be encrypted and stored separately in a secure, access-controlled data repository known as an Aadhaar Data Vault. This blog post explains how government and private entities that collect, process, and store Aadhaar data for various use cases can use AWS CloudHSM from AWS to create an Aadhaar data storage solution that can meet guidelines provided by UIDAI.</p>
