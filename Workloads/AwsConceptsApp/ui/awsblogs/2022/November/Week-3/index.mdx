          <p>Building a cloud-distributed and scalable artificial intelligence (AI) application is a cross-team effort that requires complicated management of resources and comes with numerous production concerns such as code changes, refactoring, setting up the infrastructure, and complex developer operations (DevOps). These can confuse the development process, slow down time-to-market, and keep developers from focusing on product innovation.</p>

          <p>The Poudre River Library District is a public library system in Larimer County, Colorado that serves approximately 177,000 patrons. When their integrated library system (ILS) vendor notified the Library District that the system could no longer run on their aging on-premises hardware, they were at a crossroads. After pricing out multiple options, the Library District opted to manage their own ILS migration to AWS. With an IT staff of four, the Library District completed a successful migration in six months with help from their AWS account team.</p>

          <p>To gain operational efficiencies and reduce workload burdens on employees, some state finance and tax agencies are leveraging robotic process automation (RPA) on AWS. RPA is a software tool that integrates with almost any system or application and performs manual, repetitive, time-consuming tasks. Tax agencies can use AI and ML to support the sheer size and scale of data they manage and to access and analyze all types of data with ease, including voice, video, and streaming data. Find out three ways AI and ML are creating measurable outcomes for tax agencies.</p>

          <p>Though their personal experiences in the lab were different, Sara and Gabriel, PhD student, came to the same conclusion: research labs are seriously lacking when it comes to accessibility. It&#8217;s a pervasive problem not limited to one institution or type of disability. That&#8217;s why they decided to collaborate with LabVoice&#8212;a digital lab assistant platform designed specifically for the research lab. Working together with the LabVoice team, they developed an inventory search solution that allows users to record information, like chemical location and amount, and then retrieve it later entirely through verbal prompts.</p>

          <p>Natural disasters are devastating, often resulting in loss of life, massive property damage, and damage to the critical infrastructure that powers emergency services. This can prompt public sector organizations to consider building more resilient infrastructure. Such was the case for the 911 system in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, an agency that dispatches for 21 public safety agencies including law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services, and averages over 325 calls for service per day. After a major flood in 2016 knocked out their 911 system, they worked with AWS Partner TailorBuilt Solutions, LLC. to use AWS to become resilient against disaster, reducing service interruptions and improving response times.</p>
