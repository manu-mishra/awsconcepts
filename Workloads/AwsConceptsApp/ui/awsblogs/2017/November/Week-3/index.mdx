          <p>Medinas was started to make sure every unit of medical supplies in the U.S. gets a second chance at being used before it expires. Our solution involves allowing medical facilities to sell their unused surpluses to other medical practices who can then put them to use. By algorithmically matching surpluses to existing demand on a custom marketplace, we create cost savings for all parties and simultaneously reduce the volume of supplies going to waste. But starting off in a challenging space isnt easy.</p>

          <p>In Season 4 of the hit HBO show, Silicon Valley, the character Jian Yang attempts to build an app that uses image recognition artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and label the foods in captured pictures. But there is a fairly major glitch: his app can only differentiate between hot dogs and not hot dogs. Once I stopped laughing, the episode prompted a question that centers on my role as a Solutions Architect at AWS: How easily could I build my own hotdog identifying app? Turns out, pretty easily.</p>

          <p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) has made it easier for you to create and modify your IAM policies by using a point-and-click visual editor in the IAM console. The new visual editor guides you through granting permissions using IAM policies without requiring you to write the policy in JSON (although you can still author and edit policies in JSON, if you prefer). This update to the IAM console makes it easier to grant least privilege permissions for the AWS service actions you select by listing all the supported resource types and request conditions you can specify. And, as with policy summaries, the visual editor also identifies and helps you correct unrecognized services and actions and permissions errors when you import existing policies. In this blog post, I give a brief overview of policy concepts and show you how to create a new policy by using the visual editor.</p>

          <p>Data security is paramount in many industries. Organizations that shift their IT infrastructure to the cloud must ensure that their data is protected and that the attack surface is minimized. This post focuses on a method of securely loading a subset of data from one Amazon Redshift cluster to another Amazon Redshift cluster that is located in a different AWS account.</p>

          <p>When Antoine Blondeau, the co-founder and chairman of Sentient Technologies, first began working with artificial intelligence, the concept was still known as algorithmic science. In the decades since, AI has evolved into a much sexier topic because, according to Blondeau, when operating on mission speed and plugged into the right workflow, AI will learn quicker and faster than humansresulting in business models that can evolve at machine speed. That is the revolution, notes Blondeau.</p>

          <p>Assigning credit risk to people who apply for business loans, credit cards, and home mortgages has mostly been done by weighing some 10 or 20 attributes. Take those attributesand were all familiar with some of the things that make our credit scores rise and fall, including timeliness of payments, debt to income ratio, and defaultsand crank them through your favorite logistic regression model or scorecard. The result is your assigned credit risk, and depending on the number, you either get your loan or you dont.</p>
