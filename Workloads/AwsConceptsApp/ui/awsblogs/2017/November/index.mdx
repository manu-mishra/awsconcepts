          <p>The first generation of cloud adopters had a massive advantage over the mid-market and enterprise customers who came after themtheir applications were born in the cloud. They did not have years, even decades, of legacy infrastructure running these new apps, so they were largely unencumbered to go all-in on AWS. Today, a new generation of companies is navigating a journey to AWS, and those companies have a very different set of challenges to overcome.</p>

Thats what Monika Liikamaa, CEO of Enfuce Financial Services, wants to remind other founders who complain about meeting the strict standards of financial services regulators. You have to be able to understand their concerns, she says. People are people, and they just want to feel secure that if they give a person a go, the person they say okay to knows what theyre doing. With Enfuce, the first infrastructure payments platform to run banks and financial institutions in a public cloud, Liikamaas solution to navigating the compliance process is doing her homework.

Each step involves developer collaboration. Developers also just like to collaborate on tools, methodologies, and a nice piece of code. We want to facilitate developer collaboration for migration projects, to bring more tools and methods to the community to allow better, smoother, and faster migrations. As part of this effort, we recently launched two GitHub repositories, for AWS DMS samples and AWS DMS tools.</p>

          <p>Identity is a fundamental design decision that software as a service (SaaS) architects must consider when developing a multi-tenant system. Developers who are building SaaS applications must be able to identify a user, the tenant associated with the user, the users permissions, and the relationship a tenant has with the provider, such as usage plan or tier. In this post for SaaS Technology Partners, I will explore how to architect a multi-tenant system and identify tenant context and role using Amazon Cognito.</p>

          <p>Medinas was started to make sure every unit of medical supplies in the U.S. gets a second chance at being used before it expires. Our solution involves allowing medical facilities to sell their unused surpluses to other medical practices who can then put them to use. By algorithmically matching surpluses to existing demand on a custom marketplace, we create cost savings for all parties and simultaneously reduce the volume of supplies going to waste. But starting off in a challenging space isnt easy.</p>

          <p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) has made it easier for you to create and modify your IAM policies by using a point-and-click visual editor in the IAM console. The new visual editor guides you through granting permissions using IAM policies without requiring you to write the policy in JSON (although you can still author and edit policies in JSON, if you prefer). This update to the IAM console makes it easier to grant least privilege permissions for the AWS service actions you select by listing all the supported resource types and request conditions you can specify. And, as with policy summaries, the visual editor also identifies and helps you correct unrecognized services and actions and permissions errors when you import existing policies. In this blog post, I give a brief overview of policy concepts and show you how to create a new policy by using the visual editor.</p>

          <p>When Antoine Blondeau, the co-founder and chairman of Sentient Technologies, first began working with artificial intelligence, the concept was still known as algorithmic science. In the decades since, AI has evolved into a much sexier topic because, according to Blondeau, when operating on mission speed and plugged into the right workflow, AI will learn quicker and faster than humansresulting in business models that can evolve at machine speed. That is the revolution, notes Blondeau.</p>

          <p>Assigning credit risk to people who apply for business loans, credit cards, and home mortgages has mostly been done by weighing some 10 or 20 attributes. Take those attributesand were all familiar with some of the things that make our credit scores rise and fall, including timeliness of payments, debt to income ratio, and defaultsand crank them through your favorite logistic regression model or scorecard. The result is your assigned credit risk, and depending on the number, you either get your loan or you dont.</p>

          <p>This is a guest post by Rafi Ton, founder and CEO of NUVIAD. The ability to provide fresh, up-to-the-minute data to our customers and partners was always a main goal with our platform. We saw other solutions provide data that was a few hours old, but this was not good enough for us. We insisted on providing the freshest data possible. For us, that meant loading Amazon Redshift in frequent micro batches and allowing our customers to query Amazon Redshift directly to get results in near real time. The benefits were immediately evident. Our customers could see how their campaigns performed faster than with other solutions, and react sooner to the ever-changing media supply pricing and availability. They were very happy.</p>
