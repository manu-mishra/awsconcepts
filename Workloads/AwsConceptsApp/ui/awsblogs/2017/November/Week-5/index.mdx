And send good vibes to any engineers and developers who work for e-commerce sites, such as Spring, because they too are working overtime to help us survive the madness.</p>

          <p>This is a guest post by Rafi Ton, founder and CEO of NUVIAD. The ability to provide fresh, up-to-the-minute data to our customers and partners was always a main goal with our platform. We saw other solutions provide data that was a few hours old, but this was not good enough for us. We insisted on providing the freshest data possible. For us, that meant loading Amazon Redshift in frequent micro batches and allowing our customers to query Amazon Redshift directly to get results in near real time. The benefits were immediately evident. Our customers could see how their campaigns performed faster than with other solutions, and react sooner to the ever-changing media supply pricing and availability. They were very happy.</p>
