          <p>Regulators are people too. Thats what Monika Liikamaa, CEO of Enfuce Financial Services, wants to remind other founders who complain about meeting the strict standards of financial services regulators. You have to be able to understand their concerns, she says. People are people, and they just want to feel secure that if they give a person a go, the person they say okay to knows what theyre doing. With Enfuce, the first infrastructure payments platform to run banks and financial institutions in a public cloud, Liikamaas solution to navigating the compliance process is doing her homework.

Each step involves developer collaboration. Developers also just like to collaborate on tools, methodologies, and a nice piece of code. We want to facilitate developer collaboration for migration projects, to bring more tools and methods to the community to allow better, smoother, and faster migrations.

          <p>Identity is a fundamental design decision that software as a service (SaaS) architects must consider when developing a multi-tenant system. Developers who are building SaaS applications must be able to identify a user, the tenant associated with the user, the users permissions, and the relationship a tenant has with the provider, such as usage plan or tier. In this post for SaaS Technology Partners, I will explore how to architect a multi-tenant system and identify tenant context and role using Amazon Cognito.</p>

          <p>AWS CloudFormation provides the framework to define infrastructure-as-code in AWS and, until last year, this could only be written in JSON. However, in 2016, AWS added YAML 1.1 support for CloudFormation. Lets take a look at some of the advantages of using YAML over JSON, as well as how to overcome some of the challenges [...]</p>

          <p>There are many innovations that help customers run Microsoft SQL Server workloads on AWS. We recently released a Quick Start featuring SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition, and we increased the maximum storage capacity for Amazon RDS instances running Microsoft SQL Server from 4 TB to 16 TB. In addition, Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server gained the ability to reconfigure volume type and Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) upon snapshot restore.</p>
