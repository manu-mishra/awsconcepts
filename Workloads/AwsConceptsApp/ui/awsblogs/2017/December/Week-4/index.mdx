          <p>With sensor technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning capabilities, smart cities are coming online. Cities can use technology to quickly and effectively identify areas needing government attention. Sensors can measure things from noise pollution to the fullness of public trashcans. As these technologies become more common, policymakers around the world are proving that the path to a smart, connected city begins with its residents.</p>

          <p>In my career as an entrepreneur, Ive had the opportunity to close the first deal at three different startups. There is no better feeling than when a paying customer has validated your concept and recognized your product value. That first deal has the potential to spring your company to the next 10 deals that can set your business scaling to the stratosphere. Within those first few deals lie the clues to a successful business or the pitfalls to your startup.</p>
