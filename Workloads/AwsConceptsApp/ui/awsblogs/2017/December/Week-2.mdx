          <p>Haptik is Indias first personal-assistant app. Users can use the app to plan travel, check in for flights, book taxis, and set reminders. And of all the different features, the most important and frequently used is the Reminders feature. People use Haptik to set wake-up calls, set up reminders to drink water, call people at different times, send greetings to others for different occasions, and much more. Through the reminders feature, users will receive notifications on the app along with a phone call at a requested time, relating the reminder message. In this post, we will cover how we use machine learning and text-to-speech (TTS) to set reminders for users to call them at the given time to remind them of their tasks. We will cover how Amazon Polly helped us make personalized calls to our users and helped us scale our reminders feature to millions of users.</p>

          <p>For this task, we use Hail, an open source framework for exploring and analyzing genomic data that uses the Apache Spark framework. In this post, we use Amazon EMR to run Hail. We walk through the setup, configuration, and data processing. Finally, we generate an Apache Parquetformatted variant dataset and explore it using Amazon Athena.</p>

          <p>Combatting modern forms of exploitation demands modern tools. AWS works with several national and international organizations who are committed to protecting human rights. Many nonprofit organizations rely on AWS to help prevent and expose human rights abuses through machine learning, facial and voice recognition, and more, as well as to reduce their overall IT costs so they can focus on mission-critical work.</p>
