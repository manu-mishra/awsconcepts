          <p>To drive awareness of deep learning, machine learning, and the internet of things in autonomous driving, AWS hosted a hackathonthe Robocar Rallyat re:Invent in November 2017. We kicked off Robocar Rally in September with a series of blog posts and Twitch streams. At re:Invent, we had 100 attendees come for a hands-on two-day hackathon using deep learning and the open source Donkey Car platform with AWS machine learning services and AWS IoT. They formed teams, and built, customized, trained, and raced their own 1/16th scale cars. Theres a lot we could talk about, but we think this video shows the event better than we could write about it.</p>

          <p>AWS Glue has a transform called Relationalize that simplifies the extract, transform, load (ETL) process by converting nested JSON into columns that you can easily import into relational databases. Relationalize transforms the nested JSON into key-value pairs at the outermost level of the JSON document. The transformed data maintains a list of the original keys from the nested JSON separated by periods. Lets look at how Relationalize can help you with a sample use case.</p>

There was this funny little period time where that seemed like it was a thing, Elman recently told a crowd of startup entrepreneurs at the AWS Loft in San Francisco. I think thats gone.
That doesnt mean big companies arent buying startups, Elman continued. In fact, it turns out that acquihiring didnt translate to getting better talent than just hiringits just more expensive.</p>

While he declined to name the company just yet, he did stress that the dynamics of that deal applied equally to all of his investments. One aspect in particular that Elman stressed is how he and the founders built a relationship over time. Elman didnt invest the first time he met these folks, but he kept tracking the team, and just as importantly they kept Elman in the loop.</p>
