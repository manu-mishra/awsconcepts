Were always trying new products and techniques, and combining them to pioneer new solutions for our customers. The Amazon Polly Text-To-Speech (TTS) feature is a great example of this. Already, we have top-tier publishers, sporting bodies, and Australias biggest telecommunications company using Amazon Polly to augment their established delivery methods.</p>

          <p>In Part 1 of this blog series, I talked about how Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) can help change the focus of your role as a database administrator (DBA) from routine, time-consuming tasks to project work that helps the business move faster. In this post, I discuss how you can push that advantage one step further and use AWS tools to do more through automation. An important aspect of being an effective DBA when your business is running at top speed is using code and automation whenever you can. AWS provides tools for you to make this easier.</p>

          <p>Haptik is Indias first personal-assistant app. Users can use the app to plan travel, check in for flights, book taxis, and set reminders. And of all the different features, the most important and frequently used is the Reminders feature. People use Haptik to set wake-up calls, set up reminders to drink water, call people at different times, send greetings to others for different occasions, and much more. Through the reminders feature, users will receive notifications on the app along with a phone call at a requested time, relating the reminder message. In this post, we will cover how we use machine learning and text-to-speech (TTS) to set reminders for users to call them at the given time to remind them of their tasks. We will cover how Amazon Polly helped us make personalized calls to our users and helped us scale our reminders feature to millions of users.</p>

          <p>To drive awareness of deep learning, machine learning, and the internet of things in autonomous driving, AWS hosted a hackathonthe Robocar Rallyat re:Invent in November 2017. We kicked off Robocar Rally in September with a series of blog posts and Twitch streams. At re:Invent, we had 100 attendees come for a hands-on two-day hackathon using deep learning and the open source Donkey Car platform with AWS machine learning services and AWS IoT. They formed teams, and built, customized, trained, and raced their own 1/16th scale cars. Theres a lot we could talk about, but we think this video shows the event better than we could write about it.</p>

          <p>AWS Glue has a transform called Relationalize that simplifies the extract, transform, load (ETL) process by converting nested JSON into columns that you can easily import into relational databases. Relationalize transforms the nested JSON into key-value pairs at the outermost level of the JSON document. The transformed data maintains a list of the original keys from the nested JSON separated by periods. Lets look at how Relationalize can help you with a sample use case.</p>

There was this funny little period time where that seemed like it was a thing, Elman recently told a crowd of startup entrepreneurs at the AWS Loft in San Francisco. I think thats gone.
That doesnt mean big companies arent buying startups, Elman continued. In fact, it turns out that acquihiring didnt translate to getting better talent than just hiringits just more expensive.</p>

          <p>Halloween and New Years Eve are among Ubers busiest nights of the year. According to Matt Schallert, a site reliability engineer at Uber NYC, those days can see 50-100% extra trip volume over the rest of the year. See how Matt and his team rely on AWS to make sure they are fully prepared to handle the volume of requests that come through on such ride-share heavy holidays.</p>

          <p>During a recent fireside chat at the AWS Loft in San Francisco, Greylock Partners Josh Elman Elman shared with the crowd of founders and entrepreneurs that he had just wrapped up a recent investment in a startup. While he declined to name the company just yet, he did stress that the dynamics of that deal applied equally to all of his investments. One aspect in particular that Elman stressed is how he and the founders built a relationship over time. Elman didnt invest the first time he met these folks, but he kept tracking the team, and just as importantly they kept Elman in the loop.</p>

That first deal has the potential to spring your company to the next 10 deals that can set your business scaling to the stratosphere. Within those first few deals lie the clues to a successful business or the pitfalls to your startup.</p>

          <p>With the recent launch of VMware Cloud on AWS, you can now run workloads on VMware-managed SDDC clusters installed on special bare metal hardware provided by Amazon Amazon EC2 services. This post describes a solution for securing workloads on VMware Cloud on AWS that we demonstrated at VMworld 2017. VMware workloads that run in the SDDC cluster can leverage different levels of AWS network and application protection capabilities with minimum to no changes to their application settings.</p>
