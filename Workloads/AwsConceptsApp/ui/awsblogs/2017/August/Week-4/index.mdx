          <p>In traditional single-tenant environments, calculating and aggregating infrastructure costs is a pretty straightforward exercise. Typically, each application or customer has its own collection of dedicated resources and tallying the costs is simply a matter of categorizing and summing those costs. However, in multi-tenant SaaS environments, this becomes a much more challenging problem. With SaaS, tenants often share some or all of a system&#8217;s infrastructure resources.</p>
