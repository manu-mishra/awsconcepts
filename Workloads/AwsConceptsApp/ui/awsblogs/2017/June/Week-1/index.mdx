          <p>Although it&#8217;s common for Amazon EMR customers to process data directly in Amazon S3, there are occasions where you might want to copy data from S3 to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on your Amazon EMR cluster. Additionally, you might have a use case that requires moving large amounts of data between buckets or regions. In these use cases, large datasets are too big for a simple copy operation.</p>
