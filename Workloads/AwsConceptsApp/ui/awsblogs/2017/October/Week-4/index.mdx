          <p>A data lake is an increasingly popular way to store and analyze data that addresses the challenges of dealing with massive volumes of heterogeneous data. A data lake allows organizations to store all their datastructured and unstructuredin one centralized repository. Because data can be stored as-is, there is no need to convert it to a predefined schema. This post walks you through the process of using AWS Glue to crawl your data on Amazon S3 and build a metadata store that can be used with other AWS offerings.</p>
