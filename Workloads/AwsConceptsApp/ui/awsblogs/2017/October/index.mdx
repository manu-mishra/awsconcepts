          <p>Millions of customers shop in brick and mortar stores every day. Currently, most of these retailers have no efficient way to identify these shoppers and understand their purchasing behavior. They rely on third-party market research firms to provide customer demographic and purchase preference information.
This blog post walks you how you can use AWS services to identify purchasing behavior of your customers. We show you:
How retailers can use captured images in real time.br /
How Amazon Rekognition can be used to retrieve face attributes like age range, emotions, gender, etc.br /
How you can use Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to analyze the face attributes.br /
How you can create unique insights and learn about customer emotions and demographics.br /
How to implement serverless architecture using AWS managed services.</p>
