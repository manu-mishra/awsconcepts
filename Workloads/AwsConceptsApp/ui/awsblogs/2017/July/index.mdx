          <p>When Amazon S3 analytics was released in November 2016, it gave you the ability to analyze storage access patterns and transition the right data to the right storage class. You could also manually export the data to an S3 bucket to analyze, using the business intelligence tool of your choice, and gather deeper insights on usage and growth patterns. This helped you reduce storage costs while optimizing performance based on usage patterns. With todays update, you can quickly and easily gain those deeper insights and benefits by analyzing and visualizing S3 analytics data in Amazon QuickSight. It takes just a single click from the S3 console, without the need for manual exports or additional data preparation.</p>
