          <p>To make managing your AWS account easier, some AWS services perform actions on your behalf, including the creation and management of AWS resources. For example,&#160;AWS Elastic Beanstalk&#160;automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. To make these AWS actions more transparent, AWS adds an AWS Identity and Access [...]</p>

          <p>Your users have questions and you have answers, but you need a better way for your users to ask their questions and get the right answers. They often call your help desk, or post to your support forum, but over time this adds stress and cost to your organization. Could a chat bot add value for your customers? Interestingly, a recent poll shows that 44% of people would rather talk to a chat bot than to a human! In this post we provide a sample solution, called QnABot (pronounced &#8220;Q and A Bot&#8221;). The QnABot uses Amazon Lex and Amazon Alexa to provide a conversational interface for your &#8220;Questions and Answers.&#8221; This allows your users to ask their questions and get quick and relevant answers.</p>
