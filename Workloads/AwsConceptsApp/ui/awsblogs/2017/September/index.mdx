With SaaS, your applications architecture must accommodate a continually shifting landscape of customers and load profiles. The number of customers in the system and their usage patterns can change dramatically on a dailyor even hourlybasis. These dynamics make it challenging for SaaS architects to identify a model that can efficiently anticipate and respond to these variations.</p>

          <p>Your users have questions and you have answers, but you need a better way for your users to ask their questions and get the right answers. They often call your help desk, or post to your support forum, but over time this adds stress and cost to your organization. Could a chat bot add value for your customers? Interestingly, a recent poll shows that 44% of people would rather talk to a chat bot than to a human! In this post we provide a sample solution, called QnABot (pronounced Q and A Bot). The QnABot uses Amazon Lex and Amazon Alexa to provide a conversational interface for your Questions and Answers. This allows your users to ask their questions and get quick and relevant answers.</p>
