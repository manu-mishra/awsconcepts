With SaaS, your applications architecture must accommodate a continually shifting landscape of customers and load profiles. The number of customers in the system and their usage patterns can change dramatically on a dailyor even hourlybasis. These dynamics make it challenging for SaaS architects to identify a model that can efficiently anticipate and respond to these variations.</p>
