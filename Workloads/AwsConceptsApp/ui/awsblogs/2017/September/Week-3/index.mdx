          <p>If you develop an AWS Lambda function with Node.js, you can call multiple web services without waiting for a response due to its asynchronous nature. All requests are initiated almost in parallel, so you can get results much faster than a series of sequential calls to each web service. Considering the maximum execution duration for [...]</p>

As he recently told a roomful of attendees at the AWS Startup Day in San Francisco, technological and financial advancements have finally reached a point where the old rules should no longer be treated as gospel.</p>
