          <p>One of my favorite parts of my job is meeting people and watching them innovate with Cloud technology. So I want to tell you about a recent weekend trip to the Bay Area. Last weekend I was in Mountain View, CA to attend OpenSocials WeekendApps event. This was held at the Googleplex, and was designed [...]</p>

          <p>Late last year I blogged about JumpBox . I talked about how their lineup of public EC2 AMIs really streamlined the process of getting started with a number of powerful open source applications. Earlier this week, Sean and Kimbro of JumpBox told me about their newest development, the JumpBox Rapid Trial. Powered by EC2, the [...]</p>

          <p>Earlier in my career, I thought that innovation was solely about technology. If you wanted to address a new market or to increase sales, writing more code was always a good option. Having gained some wisdom and experience over the years, Ive finally figured out the obvious that innovation can also take the form [...]</p>

          <p>Weve just released an important new feature for Amazon SimpleDB. The new BatchPutAttributes function allows you to create or update up to 25 SimpleDB items at a time, in transactional fashion. This new call is more efficient than a series of individual PutAttribute calls since one call incurs far less connection latency than a series [...]</p>
