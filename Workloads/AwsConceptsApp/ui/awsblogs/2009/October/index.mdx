          <p>Weve removed the distinction between Amazon EC2 running Windows and Amazon EC2 running Windows with Authentication Services, allowing all of our Windows instances to make use of Authentication Services such as LDAP, RADIUS, and Kerberos. With this change, any Windows instance can host a Domain Controller or join an existing domain. File sharing services such [...]</p>

          <p>Rex Chung wrote to tell me that his EC2-powered Ankoder site can now segment files for iPhone HTTP streaming. As noted in the iPhone Dev Center, HTTP streaming obviates the need for specialized servers, extra firewall entries, and other complexity. It supports live and video on demand sessions. The Ankoder blog contains a complete walkthrough [...]</p>

          <p>My evangelism trips to Asia (India in 2007, Round-trip around the world in 2008) has always been action-packed. I love these trips especially because I learn a lot, make ton of new friends while spreading the word about something I am really passionate about. Hence, this time, I plan to visit China, Singapore and India. [...]</p>

          <p>I love to speak to user groups because theres little time pressure and plenty of time to engage with the audience. As part of last weeks very pleasant trip to Iowa, I spoke to the CIALUG (Central Iowa Linux Users Group).We met in a very cool coworking space called the Impromptu Studio.

          <p>We polled the attendees at a recent Amazon SimpleDB webinar and found that over half of them didnt know that they could start using the service for free. Thats a shame because SimpleDB is easy to use, scales easily to handle high request rates, and is available in our US and EU regions. You can [...]</p>

          <p>In many cases, scaling out (by launching additional instances) is the best way to bring additional CPU processing power and memory to bear on a problem, while also distributing network traffic across multiple NICs (Network Interface Controllers). Certain workloads, however, are better supported by scaling up with a more capacious instance. Examples of these workloads [...]</p>
