          <p>We&#8217;ve removed the distinction between Amazon EC2 running Windows and Amazon EC2 running Windows with Authentication Services, allowing all of our Windows instances to make use of Authentication Services such as LDAP, RADIUS, and Kerberos. With this change, any Windows instance can host a Domain Controller or join an existing domain. File sharing services such [...]</p>

          <p>Rex Chung wrote to tell me that his EC2-powered Ankoder site can now segment files for iPhone HTTP streaming. As noted in the iPhone Dev Center, HTTP streaming obviates the need for specialized servers, extra firewall entries, and other complexity. It supports live and video on demand sessions. The Ankoder blog contains a complete walkthrough [...]</p>

          <p>My evangelism trips to Asia (India in 2007, Round-trip around the world in 2008) has always been action-packed. I love these trips especially because I learn a lot, make ton of new friends while spreading the word about something I am really passionate about. Hence, this time, I plan to visit China, Singapore and India. [...]</p>

          <p>I love to speak to user groups because there&#8217;s little time pressure and plenty of time to engage with the audience. As part of last week&#8217;s very pleasant trip to Iowa, I spoke to the CIALUG (Central Iowa Linux User&#8217;s Group).We met in a very cool coworking space called the Impromptu Studio. The audience wasn&#8217;t [...]</p>

          <p>Earlier today, Amazon&#8217;s Peter Sirota took the stage at Hadoop World and announced a number of new goodies for Amazon Elastic MapReduce. Here&#8217;s what he revealed to the crowd: Apache Hive Support Elastic MapReduce now supports Apache Hive. Hive builds on Hadoop to provide tools for data summarization, ad hoc querying, and analysis of large [...]</p>

          <p>We polled the attendees at a recent Amazon SimpleDB webinar and found that over half of them didn&#8217;t know that they could start using the service for free. That&#8217;s a shame because SimpleDB is easy to use, scales easily to handle high request rates, and is available in our US and EU regions. You can [...]</p>
