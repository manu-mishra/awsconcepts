          <p>At AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas, Compassion International participated in the Nonprofit Hackathon for Social Good. People don&#8217;t usually connect the dots between cutting-edge technology and nonprofits, but this is where it&#8217;s needed most. Hackers were challenged to bridge the communication gap between those in need and empathetic people who want to help. No matter your origin or the language you speak, you can connect and meet the needs of a child in poverty.</p>

          <p>One of the core principles of building highly available applications on AWS is to work with a multi-Availability Zone architecture. In the unlikely event an AZ fails, this allows applications to continue running using resources in the other AZs. Customers use different strategies to handle the routing of user traffic to different components of their applications across AZ, ranging from load balancers and Elastic IPs to Domain Name Resolution. In this post, we present an approach to achieve failover of a private IP address across AZs.</p>

          <p>As part of our commitment to making science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers accessible to students, we host AWS Field Trips to engage young students with cloud technology. Three years ago, the AWS Field Trip program started at AWS re:Invent to inspire and engage middle school students to pursue STEM education and careers by exposing them to fun, hands-on engagements with technology. Since then, the program has scaled to Madrid, Spain, and Ottawa, Canada, reaching middle school students globally. This year, AWS Field Trips are expanding to several 2019 AWS Summits globally, reaching more students and providing a pathway for continued learning through AWS Educate.</p>

          <p>Amazon Kinesis launched two significant performance-improving features for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams: enhanced fan-out and an HTTP/2 data retrieval API (&#8220;SubscribeToShard&#8221;). This API allows data to be delivered from producers to consumers in 70 milliseconds or better. Today, we&#8217;re excited to announce the support for Kinesis SubscribeToShard API in the AWS SDK for Ruby. Before [...]</p>

          <p>November 1, 2021: AWS KMS is replacing the term customer master key (CMK) with AWS KMS key and KMS key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, AWS KMS is keeping some variations of this term. More info. Using temporary credentials is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practice.

          <p>While data is extremely important in all technology industries, this importance is perhaps taken to another level with autonomous driving. Autonomous vehicles, for example, will generate roughly four to five terabytes of data an hour, meaning a fleet of 2,000 cars will generate more data a day than Facebook. That&#8217;s per Chris Heiser, Co-Founder and CEO of Renovo, a startup built to help companies process these new streams of data.</p>

          <p>In this blog post, we&#8217;ll discuss how to implement custom, state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization (HPO) algorithms to tune models on Amazon SageMaker. Amazon SageMaker includes a built-in HPO algorithm, but provides the flexibility to use your own HPO algorithm. We&#8217;ll provide you with a framework to incorporate an HPO algorithm that you choose. However, before we [...]</p>
