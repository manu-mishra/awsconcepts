          <p>Early in your career it is important to find individuals that you respect and admire to act as mentors. I still have mentors, and I still ask questions. You need to remember that the onus is on you to use your mentors time. You need to be prescriptive when it comes to asking for their help. Come to them with specific questions and give them perspective on where you need guidance. Approaching a mentor with a clear understanding of where you need guidance is key to respecting their time and getting the most of yours.</p>

          <p>Governments face stiff competition with the private sector when it comes to recruiting civil servants with digital skills. As they look to innovate and make their services more citizen-centric, government leaders can benefit from bold strategies to recruit diverse, digitally savvy talent. Dr. Wendy Cukier, Director of the Diversity Institute at Ryerson University, explores the challenges facing the Canadian public service and recommendations to develop the federal workforce, in a new paper produced in collaboration with Public Policy Forum and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Institute. While the paper focuses on Canada, the strategies offered are relevant to leaders around the world.</p>

          <p>One of the core principles of building highly available applications on AWS is to work with a multi-Availability Zone architecture. In the unlikely event an AZ fails, this allows applications to continue running using resources in the other AZs. Customers use different strategies to handle the routing of user traffic to different components of their applications across AZ, ranging from load balancers and Elastic IPs to Domain Name Resolution. In this post, we present an approach to achieve failover of a private IP address across AZs.</p>

          <p>People sometimes underestimate lawyers because we are annoying, and we come there, and we just create problems.

Since then, the program has scaled to Madrid, Spain, and Ottawa, Canada, reaching middle school students globally. This year, AWS Field Trips are expanding to several 2019 AWS Summits globally, reaching more students and providing a pathway for continued learning through AWS Educate.</p>

Autonomous vehicles, for example, will generate roughly four to five terabytes of data an hour, meaning a fleet of 2,000 cars will generate more data a day than Facebook. Thats per Chris Heiser, Co-Founder and CEO of Renovo, a startup built to help companies process these new streams of data.</p>

To enable disaster response organizations access to cloud services at the edge, even in the harshest conditions, we announced the launch of the AWS Disaster Response Program (AWS DRP). he AWS DRP team focuses on building strategic relationships with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGO), nonprofit organizations (NPO), and educational institutions focusing on disaster response. Additionally, the AWS DRP is developing a capability to deploy technical AWS staff during disasters and directly aid disaster-responding organizations in leveraging AWS technology called the AWS Disaster Response Action Team (AWS DRT).</p>

          <p>Cities spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to do point-in-time traffic studies. Those studies assist cities in planning traffic signal timings and detours during street-closures. The City of Louisville, Kentucky, was paying every year for traffic studies and analysis and was getting static reports back. Instead, Louisville decided to use real-time congestion data freely available to governments through the Waze CCP (Connected Citizens Program). Combined with other information like built environment data and collision reports, Louisville could bring this together in the cloud for advanced analytics.</p>
