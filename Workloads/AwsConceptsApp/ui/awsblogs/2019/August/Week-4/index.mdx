          <p>Many organizations are looking to migrate existing, on-premises enterprise data warehouse systems to cloud-based data warehouse systems such as Amazon Redshift. Here, we discuss how Cognizant&#8217;s Intelligent Migration Workbench (IMW) can be used to accelerate the data warehouse migrations while converting Oracle PL/SQL and Tetradata BTEQ scripts. IMW makes it easy to move mission critical proprietary code to AWS, giving customers competitive edge through faster time to market.</p>

          <p>Scheduling when to provision Amazon EMR clusters allows data scientists to run analytics workloads at their own schedule. Scheduling when to terminate clusters allows them to run analytics workloads only when they need them. Here, we demonstrates how to automatically schedule provisioning and termination of EMR clusters by utilizing AWS Service Catalog Connector for ServiceNow. The capability discussed in this post can also be extended to other AWS services.</p>
