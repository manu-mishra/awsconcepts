          <p>Microservices-based applications architectures are the norm for building scalable applications. AWS makes creating these types of applications easier with Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility). Just bring your code and deploy an application with this fast, scalable, highly available, and fully managed document database service that supports MongoDB workloads. You can use the same MongoDB application [...]</p>

          <p>Microsoft SQL Server 2017 supports Always On availability groups between Windows and Linux to create read-scale workloads without high availability (HA). Unfortunately, you cannot achieve HA between Windows and Linux because there is no clustered solution that can manage that cross-platform configuration. To use HA with Always On availability groups, consider using a Windows Server [...]</p>
