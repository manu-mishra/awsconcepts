The AWS Snowball Edge is capable of petabyte-scale data transport with on-board storage and dense compute capabilities. It was engineered to perform in some of the worlds most extreme environments, including warzones at the tactical edge, in a secure and transportable fashion.</p>

          <p>Amazon always works backwards from the customers needs. Customers have made strong requests that they want stored procedures in Amazon Redshift, to make it easier to migrate their existing workloads from legacy, on-premises data warehouses.
With that primary goal in mind, AWS chose to implement PL/pqSQL stored procedure to maximize compatibility with existing procedures and simplify migrations. In this post, we discuss how and where to use stored procedures to improve operational efficiency and security. We also explain how to use stored procedures with AWS Schema Conversion Tool.</p>

          <p>This post presents a simple approach to aggregating AWS WAF logs into a central data lake repository, which lets teams better analyze and understand their organizations security posture. I walk through the steps to aggregate regional AWS WAF logs into a dedicated S3 bucket. I follow that up by demonstrating how you can use Amazon ES to visualize the log data. I also present an option to offload and process historical data using AWS Glue ETL. With the data collected in one place, I finally show you how you can use Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to query historical data and extract business insights.</p>

          <p>Video is everywhere from TV sets to mobile displays, digital billboards, and even classrooms. With consumers often glued to their digital devices, video has quickly become a preferred instructional tool for teachers and learning aid for students. Recognizing this trend, education and technology company Cengage incorporates video into almost all of its instructional and research materials, which are tapped by teachers and students in classrooms, as well as K12, public, and academic libraries across the world. Cengages Library and Research business unit, Gale, takes a similar approach with its educational materials.</p>

          <p>While the oil and gas industry has a great history of collaboration on engineering and technology and is the source of many pioneering inventions, it is also highly regulated, under significant competitive pressures, and capital intensive, which has resulted in the creation of barriers to the sharing of information at an industry level, Rana Basu says. Thats why he and his Co-Founder Jean-Pierre Foehn decided to start Ondiflo, with the goal of delivering the benefits of IOTs, machine learning, and blockchain technology.</p>

          <p>Have you ever noticed that when businesses talk about data, they often use metaphors having to do with water? In the same way plumbing makes modern life possible, a well-maintained data infrastructure is a crucial foundation on which the health of a business depends. Examine how replacing an inflexible, legacy data system with a cloud data warehousing solution can open the floodgates to new opportunities and modernize the approach to data management.</p>

          <p>Amazon Comprehend Medical is a natural language processing (NLP) service that simplifies the use of machine learning (ML) to extract relevant medical information from unstructured text often found in clinical charts or doctors notes. Since the service launched in the AWS Canada (Central) Region in June 2019, it opened up possibilities for Canadian healthcare organizations to better serve patients. Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) and University of British Columbia (UBC) researchers are among the organizations who leverage Amazon Comprehend Medical and Amazon SageMaker, to create their own machine learning models that can triage x-rays to provide a better healthcare experience.</p>

          <p>Last week, our colleague Ed Lima published a post on the AWS Mobile blog about building apps with Amplify. This post shows how to use a variety of AWS services to build a progressive web app that collects survey information from customers. After collecting the customer information, the application sends usage data to Amazon Pinpoint [...]</p>

          <p>Deploying analytics applications and machine learning models requires storage that can scale in capacity and performance to handle workload demands with high throughput and low-latency file operations. A common use case were seeing centers around data science teams doing some form of analytics (e.g machine learning, genomics). AWS offers two scalable, durable, highly available file [...]</p>

          <p>This post describes how you can improve performance and reduce costs by offloading reporting workloads from an online transaction processing (OLTP) database to Amazon Athena and Amazon S3. The architecture described allows you to implement a reporting system and have an understanding of the data that you receive by being able to query it on arrival.</p>

          <p>The increasing adoption of containerized applications and microservices also brings an increased burden for monitoring and management. Builders have an expectation of, and requirement for, the same level of monitoring as would be used with longer lived infrastructure such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. By contrast containers are relatively short-lived, and usually [...]</p>
