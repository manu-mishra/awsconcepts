          <p>The AWS Snowball Edge looks unassuming. Weighing in at under 50 pounds, it can be checked as a standard piece of airplane luggage, and yet, it is an extremely durable, portable piece of hardware. The AWS Snowball Edge is capable of petabyte-scale data transport with on-board storage and dense compute capabilities. It was engineered to perform in some of the world&#8217;s most extreme environments, including warzones at the tactical edge, in a secure and transportable fashion.</p>

          <p>Amazon always works backwards from the customer&#8217;s needs. Customers have made strong requests that they want stored procedures in Amazon Redshift, to make it easier to migrate their existing workloads from legacy, on-premises data warehouses.
With that primary goal in mind, AWS chose to implement PL/pqSQL stored procedure to maximize compatibility with existing procedures and simplify migrations. In this post, we discuss how and where to use stored procedures to improve operational efficiency and security. We also explain how to use stored procedures with AWS Schema Conversion Tool.</p>

          <p>This post presents a simple approach to aggregating AWS WAF logs into a central data lake repository, which lets teams better analyze and understand their organization&#8217;s security posture. I walk through the steps to aggregate regional AWS WAF logs into a dedicated S3 bucket. I follow that up by demonstrating how you can use Amazon ES to visualize the log data. I also present an option to offload and process historical data using AWS Glue ETL. With the data collected in one place, I finally show you how you can use Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to query historical data and extract business insights.</p>

With consumers often glued to their digital devices, video has quickly become a preferred instructional tool for teachers and learning aid for students.

Cengage&#8217;s Library and Research business unit, Gale, takes a similar approach with its educational materials.</p>
