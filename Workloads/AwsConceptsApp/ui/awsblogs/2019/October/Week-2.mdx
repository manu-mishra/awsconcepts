          <p>Learn how to seamlessly integrateAmazon Rekognitionwith the Cloudinary platform, and build an application that automatically tags people in images with names. This solution learns peoples faces from photos uploaded to a training folder in Cloudinary. In many cases, a single photo of someone is enough forAmazon Rekognition to learn and then, later on, identify and tag that person. This works in most photograph scenes and even pictures with many other people in them.</p>

          <p>As AWS adoption continues to grow, the need for highly reliable workload migrations at an accelerated pace is paramount. This is particularly true for enterprises turning to AWS to host mission-critical and legacy applications. Organizations need a solution that expedites the migration process, without introducing further risk. TDS TransitionManager with CloudEndure Migration is an AWS solution that accelerates cloud migration projects while reducing risk through automated processes.</p>

          <p>In this post, I show how to use AWS Step Functions and AWS Glue Python Shell to orchestrate tasks for those Amazon Redshift-based ETL workflows in a completely serverless fashion. AWS Glue Python Shell is a Python runtime environment for running small to medium-sized ETL tasks, such as submitting SQL queries and waiting for a response. Step Functions lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into workflows so you can easily run and monitor a series of ETL tasks. Both AWS Glue Python Shell and Step Functions are serverless, allowing you to automatically run and scale them in response to events you define, rather than requiring you to provision, scale, and manage servers.</p>
