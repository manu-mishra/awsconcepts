          <p>Public sector organizations are under more pressure than ever to keep data secure, control costs, and empower workers to be more productive. Traditional on-premises tools, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), application streaming, and mobile access management software, are hard to secure and lack flexibility and scale. As many organizations are looking at cloud-based solutions to meet their needs, its important to note that there is more to cloud-based end user computing (EUC) projects than simply moving Microsoft Office products to the cloud. Organizations should take a comprehensive look at their strategic needs and challenges when evaluating cloud-based EUC solutions.</p>

          <p>This post discusses installing notebook-scoped libraries on a running cluster directly via an EMR Notebook. Before this feature, you had to rely on bootstrap actions or use custom AMI to install additional libraries that are not pre-packaged with the EMR AMI when you provision the cluster. This post also discusses how to use the pre-installed Python libraries available locally within EMR Notebooks to analyze and plot your results. This capability is useful in scenarios in which you dont have access to a PyPI repository but need to analyze and visualize a dataset.</p>

          <p>The Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance (CGPS) is based at the Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge and The Big Data Institute, University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Much of its work involves collaborating with laboratories around the world to enhance genomic surveillance by using big data, engineering, training, and genomic capacity building. Ultimately, the Centre hopes to enable the linking and real-time interpretation of data globally to track pathogens and antimicrobial resistance at an affordable rate. Typically, spikes in cost for research are a common challenge for laboratories. With the cloud, the team wanted to mitigate their costs, and particularly those of their partners in low and middle-income countries, by exploring the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Clouds pay-as-you-go infrastructure.</p>

To stand out companies and brands will need to maximize the value of their content and understand how a story, a posting, a video can be optimized to leverage consumers interest. Identifying and owning the relevant data to achieve this is just the first step in the new workflow. Aiconix, named one of the 30 most promising startups in the German speaking regions by Forbes magazine, is doing just that.</p>

          <p>Learn how to seamlessly integrateAmazon Rekognitionwith the Cloudinary platform, and build an application that automatically tags people in images with names. This solution learns peoples faces from photos uploaded to a training folder in Cloudinary. In many cases, a single photo of someone is enough forAmazon Rekognition to learn and then, later on, identify and tag that person. This works in most photograph scenes and even pictures with many other people in them.</p>

          <p>In this post, I show how to use AWS Step Functions and AWS Glue Python Shell to orchestrate tasks for those Amazon Redshift-based ETL workflows in a completely serverless fashion. AWS Glue Python Shell is a Python runtime environment for running small to medium-sized ETL tasks, such as submitting SQL queries and waiting for a response. Step Functions lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into workflows so you can easily run and monitor a series of ETL tasks. Both AWS Glue Python Shell and Step Functions are serverless, allowing you to automatically run and scale them in response to events you define, rather than requiring you to provision, scale, and manage servers.</p>

          <p>This October, more than 200 investors and entrepreneurs will gather in New York City for a pitch and panel event where four seasoned founders, whittled down from a list of 200 contenders, will compete for a $20,000 prize. Just one winner will snag the cash, but no one will walk away empty-handed, since the event is designed to provide female founders with the contacts, funding, networking opportunities, and resources that male founders have already been receiving for decades.</p>

          <p>With the shift to containers and serverless solutions, organizations are presented with a unique question: how do you maximize an applications uptime while maintaining a cost-effective infrastructure at both layers? Keeping availability high by over-provisioning is easy, but its also very expensive. As a result, several challenges have arisen on the path to building an optimized, cost-effective, and highly available containerized infrastructure on AWS: pricing, instance sizing, and containers utilization.</p>

          <p>Solcast produces real-time, historical and forecast estimates of the available solar radiation resources around the globe. Altogether, this requires processing imagery from five geostationary weather satellites, which take snapshots of the Earth from space every 5-15 minutes. These images can be as fine as 1 kilometer in spatial resolution and are re-captured and transmitted as frequently as every five minutes a large volume of data. A single third-generation weather satellite in orbit over the United States such as the GOES-16 generates nearly two terabytes (TB) of data each month.</p>

          <p>The first post of this series discusses two key AWS Glue capabilities to manage the scaling of data processing jobs. The first allows you to horizontally scale out Apache Spark applications for large splittable datasets. The second allows you to vertically scale up memory-intensive Apache Spark applications with the help of new AWS Glue worker types. The post also shows how to use AWS Glue to scale Apache Spark applications with a large number of small files commonly ingested from streaming applications using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Finally, the post shows how AWS Glue jobs can use the partitioning structure for large datasets in Amazon S3 to provide faster execution times for Apache Spark applications.</p>

          <p>When considering digital transformation, governments tend to focus on the potential drawbacks instead of focusing on the risks of failing to adopt new technologies. A newly released report by Ottawa-based Public Policy Forum and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Institute, The Risk of the Digital Status Quo, outlines four risks of forgoing digital modernization in Canada and offers strategies to address those risks.</p>

          <p>Mainframe proprietary storage solutions such as VTLs hold valuable data locked in a platform with complex tools. This can lead to higher compute and storage costs, and make it harder to retain existing employees or train new ones. When mainframe data is stored in a cloud storage service, however, it can be accessed by a rich ecosystem of applications and analytics tools. Model9 enables mainframe customers to backup and archive directly to AWS.</p>

          <p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) the technology that won the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry lets scientists peer into the molecular machines at work in our cells in ways that were previously impossible. Using advanced microscopes, cryo-EM captures images of proteins flash-frozen in vitreous ice, revealing their 3D structure in near-native states. Even as access to this technology improves, many researchers are still limited by computing bottlenecks. The cryo-EM field needs to provide more hands-on training in how to process such large datasets. Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows us to provide training, broadening the impact of this important structural biology technology.</p>

          <p>Emergencies and national disasters can strike at any moment. And with the change in how people communicate from the internet to cell phones and more emergency response systems need to be modernized to meet the immediate urgent needs of constituents.

AWS provides a set of cloud-based disaster recovery services that enable fast recovery of your IT infrastructure and data.</p>
