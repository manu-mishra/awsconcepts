          <p>This October, more than 200 investors and entrepreneurs will gather in New York City for a pitch and panel event where four seasoned founders, whittled down from a list of 200 contenders, will compete for a $20,000 prize. Just one winner will snag the cash, but no one will walk away empty-handed, since the event is designed to provide female founders with the contacts, funding, networking opportunities, and resources that male founders have already been receiving for decades.</p>

          <p>More than 400 regional and local organizations working to address homelessness in the United States are using a new tool by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to better understand and address the homelessness challenge. Those agencies, also known as Continuums of Care (CoCs), can use the tool to visualize the situation they are helping address and optimize their responses.</p>

          <p>With the shift to containers and serverless solutions, organizations are presented with a unique question: how do you maximize an applications uptime while maintaining a cost-effective infrastructure at both layers? Keeping availability high by over-provisioning is easy, but its also very expensive. As a result, several challenges have arisen on the path to building an optimized, cost-effective, and highly available containerized infrastructure on AWS: pricing, instance sizing, and containers utilization.</p>

          <p>Solcast produces real-time, historical and forecast estimates of the available solar radiation resources around the globe. Altogether, this requires processing imagery from five geostationary weather satellites, which take snapshots of the Earth from space every 5-15 minutes. These images can be as fine as 1 kilometer in spatial resolution and are re-captured and transmitted as frequently as every five minutes a large volume of data. A single third-generation weather satellite in orbit over the United States such as the GOES-16 generates nearly two terabytes (TB) of data each month.</p>

          <p>The first post of this series discusses two key AWS Glue capabilities to manage the scaling of data processing jobs. The first allows you to horizontally scale out Apache Spark applications for large splittable datasets. The second allows you to vertically scale up memory-intensive Apache Spark applications with the help of new AWS Glue worker types. The post also shows how to use AWS Glue to scale Apache Spark applications with a large number of small files commonly ingested from streaming applications using Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. Finally, the post shows how AWS Glue jobs can use the partitioning structure for large datasets in Amazon S3 to provide faster execution times for Apache Spark applications.</p>

          <p>When considering digital transformation, governments tend to focus on the potential drawbacks instead of focusing on the risks of failing to adopt new technologies. A newly released report by Ottawa-based Public Policy Forum and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Institute, The Risk of the Digital Status Quo, outlines four risks of forgoing digital modernization in Canada and offers strategies to address those risks.</p>
