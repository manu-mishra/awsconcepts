Realizing they needed to compete with the convenience of online rivals, DiPietro explains, the business needed to find a way to bring the in-person customer experience online.</p>

This can lead to higher compute and storage costs, and make it harder to retain existing employees or train new ones. When mainframe data is stored in a cloud storage service, however, it can be accessed by a rich ecosystem of applications and analytics tools. Model9 enables mainframe customers to backup and archive directly to AWS.</p>
