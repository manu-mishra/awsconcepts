          <p>It&#8217;s no surprise that organizations are worried about becoming locked in to their cloud provider. After all, the history of IT is full of examples of vendors taking advantage of high switching costs to impose restrictive licensing terms and to increase prices. But the cloud is different&#8212;and in fact, is making it harder and harder for software, hardware, and IT service vendors to take advantage of the leverage that they have had in the past.</p>

          <p>In California alone, hundreds of thousands of previous marijuana offenders are haunted by a blemished record, even after the passing of the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, or Prop 64, in 2016. Two years later, only&#160;a tiny fraction of all marijuana convictions in the state have been reported. To help solve this challenge, Code for America is providing much-needed guidance to petitioners through&#160;Clear My Record, a free service built on AWS that helps people with criminal records begin the clearance process.</p>
