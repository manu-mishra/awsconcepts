          <p>Enterprises, nonprofits, and startups around the globe are using the cloud to accelerate innovation in geospatial workflows to respond to natural disasters, fuel precision agriculture, plan city infrastructure, provide weather forecasts, and drive a myriad of other purposes. We convened an Earth on AWS session at the 2018 ESA -week event, with presentations and discussions from experts showing how theyre using the AWS Cloud to unlock value from geospatial data and learn more about our world.</p>

          <p>To keep pace with AWS innovation, many customers allow their application teams to experiment with AWS services in sandbox environments as they move toward production-ready architecture. These teams need timely access to various sets of AWS services and resources, which means they also need a mechanism to help ensure least privilege is granted. In other [...]</p>

          <p>Companies still rely on mission-critical applications running on Sun SPARC, Alpha, or other legacy systems like PDP, VAX, or HP 3000. Maintenance costs for these systems goes up as time goes on, and reliability declines due to their age. Fortunately, they can be re-hosted on AWS in a matter of days using cross-platform hypervisors from Stromasys. Here, we describe the challenges customers face with legacy systems, the Stromasys technical solution, and a successful customer migration to AWS.</p>

          <p>As some economies develop, small businesses that also develop and grow can sometimes be left out in the rain when searching for capital. Banks frequently look for collateral to be posted with loans, which can be difficult for smaller companies. This gap in offering is exactly where many startups are flourishing via assessing companies credit statuses through atypical methods or data, and providing financing to the previously underserved. Konfo, a fintech startup founded in 2013, does just that for micro-businesses throughout Latin America.</p>
