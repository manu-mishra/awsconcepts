          <p>In 2006, Mike Ford and Mike Rogers were working together at a health tech startup digitizing paper-based claims sent from hospitals to medical funds. At the time, Ford had an investment in a local hostel through which he gained unique insight into how the Internet was disrupting hospitality management. He experienced the struggles of hoteliers who couldnt connect their systems with online booking sites to centrally manage their rates and availability, and drew a striking resemblance to the conversion problems that he and Rogers were solving between hospitals and medical funds. Ford quickly worked with Rogers to build what would become their flagship product. From that, SiteMinder was born.</p>

          <p>This post provides a detailed walkthrough of two new encryption options to help you secure your EMR cluster that handles sensitive data. The first option is native EBS encryption to encrypt volumes attached to EMR clusters. The second option is an Amazon S3 encryption that allows you to use different encryption modes and customer master keys (CMKs) for individual S3 buckets with Amazon EMR.</p>

          <p>There is no question that the amount of choice in platforms and building blocks for software engineers is exploding. Traditionally, what was handled by separate teams with purpose-built hardware has now shifted to code (and infrastructure as code). This represents a fundamental shift in software architecture and responsibility that software engineering teams have to maintain.</p>

          <p>Amazon QuickSight now offers enhanced dashboard interactivity capabilities through QuickSight Actions. QuickSight Actions provide advanced filtering capabilities through single point-and-click actions on dashboards. With Actions, you can link visuals within a dashboard so that selecting a dimensional point on one visual provides you with granular insights on the selected point on other visuals within your dashboard. Therefore, you can start with summaries and dive deep into details of your business metrics, all within the same dashboard sheet. You can define what visuals within your dashboard are interactive and how these interact with each other. As of this writing, QuickSight Actions lets you define two primary actions of interactivity: filter actions and URL actions. URL actions within Amazon QuickSight are not new, but the point of entry to create URL actions is now consolidated with Actions.</p>

          <p>To help solve a few challenges I faced with my family, including the need to track the location of a child, I needed a serverless global positioning system (GPS) monitoring solution. Commercial geographic monitoring GPS solutions are not cost-effective because of the cost of digital map licenses from third parties and running servers around the clock. Existing GPS systems work with proprietary GPS devices that lock-in the users vendors devices. My solution? Build my own serverless GPS monitoring and alerting solution.</p>

          <p>With the proliferation of cost-effective storage options such as Amazon S3, there should be no reason you cant keep your data forever, except that with this much data it can be difficult to create value in a timely and efficient way. MongoDBs Atlas Data Lake enables developers to mine their data for insights with more storage options and the speed and agility of the AWS Cloud. It provides a serverless parallelized compute platform that gives you a powerful and flexible way to analyze and explore your data on Amazon S3.</p>
