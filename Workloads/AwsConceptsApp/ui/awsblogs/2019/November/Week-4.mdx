          <p>AWS successfully completed the re-certification audits with no findings. Ernst and Young Certify Point auditors issued the new certificates on November 6, 2019, marking the start of the new three-year cycle.

          <p>This past year, I was lucky enough to work with a number of different seed funds and seed stage startups, helping them to grow and succeed on AWS. This journey took me to many conferences, and private and public events, such as the seed enterprise summit Flight 2019. Organized by Crane Venture Partners, the summit featured a string of successful entrepreneurs and early employees sharing their experience and insights. Below are the seven most important lessons I took away, that Id love to share with you:</p>

          <p>To help solve a few challenges I faced with my family, including the need to track the location of a child, I needed a serverless global positioning system (GPS) monitoring solution. Commercial geographic monitoring GPS solutions are not cost-effective because of the cost of digital map licenses from third parties and running servers around the clock. Existing GPS systems work with proprietary GPS devices that lock-in the users vendors devices. My solution? Build my own serverless GPS monitoring and alerting solution.</p>

          <p>With the proliferation of cost-effective storage options such as Amazon S3, there should be no reason you cant keep your data forever, except that with this much data it can be difficult to create value in a timely and efficient way. MongoDBs Atlas Data Lake enables developers to mine their data for insights with more storage options and the speed and agility of the AWS Cloud. It provides a serverless parallelized compute platform that gives you a powerful and flexible way to analyze and explore your data on Amazon S3.</p>
