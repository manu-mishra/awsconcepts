          <p>This post provides a detailed walkthrough of two new encryption options to help you secure your EMR cluster that handles sensitive data. The first option is native EBS encryption to encrypt volumes attached to EMR clusters. The second option is an Amazon S3 encryption that allows you to use different encryption modes and customer master keys (CMKs) for individual S3 buckets with Amazon EMR.</p>

          <p>Best practices for AWS cloud deployments include the use of multiple accounts and/or multiple regions. Multiple accounts provide a security and billing boundary that isolates resources and reduces the impact of issues. Multiple regions ensures a high degree of isolation, low latency for end users, and data resiliency of applications. These best practices can come [...]</p>
