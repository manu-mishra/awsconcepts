          <p>Data and analytics success relies on providing analysts and data end users with quick, easy access to accurate, quality data. Enterprises need a high performing and cost-efficient data architecture that supports demand for data access, while providing the data governance and management capabilities required by IT. Data management excellence, which is best achieved via a data lake on AWS, captures and makes quality data available to analysts in a fast and cost-effective way.</p>
