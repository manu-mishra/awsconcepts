          <p>Many enterprises are adopting cloud-based strategies as they initiate new projects or migrate from older, legacy systems. To meet demanding and rapidly changing business needs, they employ frequent code releases, increasingly use containers, and process and store data for compliance. Its an environment with a great deal of change and activity, but solutions like SIEMs and firewalls just cant provide the level of insight requiredthey arent built for automation or scale.</p>

          <p>Currently, there are 150 million chemicals registered and managed by the American Chemical Society. Every day, 15,000 to 20,000 new chemicals are registered. These chemicals are present in everything from our household cleaning products to the food we eat. But how do these chemicals affect us? And how do they affect the environment? A research group at the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management at UC Santa Barbara, with funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), works to answer those questions for the masses with the Chemical Life Cycle Collaborative (CLiCC) tool.</p>

          <p>Before a developer can commit their first line of code, they must think about the security of their application. With a move toward a DevSecOps culture, security is not solely the job of the security team in the same way that infrastructure and deployment are not the sole responsibilities of the operations team. Developers should partake in both operations and security, as they know their own application best. This blog outlines a framework for thinking about security for your apps infrastructure and how AWS product features can address those concerns.</p>

          <p>As technology makes it easier to connect with constituents, state and local governments are looking to build systems centered around and empowered by the citizen experience.

In a keynote address to over 800 government health IT leaders, Taha Kass-Hout, senior leader of healthcare and artificial intelligence at Amazon Web Services (AWS), said, Its not for a lack of technology, and its not for a lack of passion. Its about the difficulty alleviating the heavy lifting that leaves agencies extremely resource constrained.</p>

          <p>In 2018, AWS launched its Hackdays program, offering teams from around ASEAN the opportunity and resources to build projects and compete for prizes, the top of which was a trip to Las Vegas for the annual re:Invent conference. Over 1,000 developers from countries including Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand formed teams to develop new technologies during a one day hackathon. The winners of those days then squared off in Jakarta, with the team from Thailand ultimately winning the top prize and the trip to Las Vegas.</p>
