          <p>Despite being a U.S. territory, Puerto Ricos healthcare landscape is vastly different from the mainland. Federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid is 40-50% lower than the average U.S. state, creating financial strains for hospitals and providers managing those patients. Federal incentives for using electronic medical records are also far lower, with many hospitals and clinics choosing to stay on paper. At Health Gorilla, were committed to making interoperability actionable in real-world clinical practice.</p>

          <p>In 2018, AWS launched its Hackdays program, offering teams from around ASEAN the opportunity and resources to build projects and compete for prizes, the top of which was a trip to Las Vegas for the annual re:Invent conference. Over 1,000 developers from countries including Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand formed teams to develop new technologies during a one day hackathon. The winners of those days then squared off in Jakarta, with the team from Thailand ultimately winning the top prize and the trip to Las Vegas.</p>

          <p>Companies used to assume that computing infrastructures would remain on-premises before eventually moving over completely to the cloud. That assumption has been proved false, as more organizations recognize the need for a hybrid cloud. This could be for regulatory reasonsthe financial and health care sectors, for example, might be required to keep some of their workloads on data centersor other concerns.</p>
