          <p>Many enterprises are adopting cloud-based strategies as they initiate new projects or migrate from older, legacy systems. To meet demanding and rapidly changing business needs, they employ frequent code releases, increasingly use containers, and process and store data for compliance. It&#8217;s an environment with a great deal of change and activity, but solutions like SIEMs and firewalls just can&#8217;t provide the level of insight required&#8212;they aren&#8217;t built for automation or scale.</p>

          <p>Currently, there are 150 million chemicals registered and managed by the American Chemical Society. Every day, 15,000 to 20,000 new chemicals are registered. These chemicals are present in everything from our household cleaning products to the food we eat. But how do these chemicals affect us? And how do they affect the environment? A research group at the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management at UC Santa Barbara, with funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), works to answer those questions for the masses with the Chemical Life Cycle Collaborative (CLiCC) tool.</p>

Until recently, deployments were one of the biggest pain points for our engineers and with a two-person DevOps team we inevitably became a massive bottleneck when it came to go-live. We knew we needed to find a better way of doing things, and as existing AWS users, AWS Fargate seemed like the natural way forward.</p>

          <p>Before a developer can commit their first line of code, they must think about the security of their application. With a move toward a DevSecOps culture, security is not solely the job of the security team -  in the same way that infrastructure and deployment are not the sole responsibilities of the operations team. Developers should partake in both operations and security, as they know their own application best. This blog outlines a framework for thinking about security for your app&#8217;s infrastructure and how AWS&#8217; product features can address those concerns.</p>
