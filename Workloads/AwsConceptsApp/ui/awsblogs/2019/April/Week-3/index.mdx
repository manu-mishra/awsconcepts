          <p>As technology makes it easier to connect with constituents, state and local governments are looking to build systems centered around and empowered by the citizen experience.

Public health systems often struggle to connect data across agencies and systemsleaving some communities without the insights they need to optimally allocate resources or to take action in the face of emerging epidemics. In a keynote address to over 800 government health IT leaders, Taha Kass-Hout, senior leader of healthcare and artificial intelligence at Amazon Web Services (AWS), said, Its not for a lack of technology, and its not for a lack of passion. Its about the difficulty alleviating the heavy lifting that leaves agencies extremely resource constrained.</p>
