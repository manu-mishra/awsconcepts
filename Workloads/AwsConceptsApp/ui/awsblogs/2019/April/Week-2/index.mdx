          <p>Imagine you&#8217;re a car manufacturer who wants to advertise on a news site, but you don&#8217;t want your advertisement to run alongside a story about the diesel emissions scandal. Or you sell something in an online shop and need to comb through the reviews, social media feeds and comments to figure out what users want in the next product upgrade or what they think of your customer service. Building a tool that could aggregate and analyze all the keywords, phrases and tonalities&#8212;whether the sentiment is positive or negative&#8212;would take a couple of years, a specialized development team, and at least half a million dollars. Enter hyScore.io, a customizable API that combines natural language processing and machine learning to create solutions for native advertising, contextual targeting, URL/text inventory searches and any number of other uses.</p>
