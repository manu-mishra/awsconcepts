          <p>While fashion is sometimes seen as rarified and impenetrable, the reality is that most people engage with it on a daily basis.

          <p>Oceans are made for exploration. That seems to be the subtext of the evocatively named Datameer, which uses Meer, the German word for ocean, to position itself in juxtaposition with data lakes. The name Datameer hints at the immensity and power of data, which shapes lives today in much the same way that ocean currents shaped those in previous centuries. It also hints at the sheer inscrutability of data. For most people, being presented with raw data and asked to interpret it is as bewildering as being presented with a view of a flat sea and told to list statistics about local fish populations. Thats where Datameer comes in.</p>

The complexity of IT environments, the rate of change, the cost pressures, the increasing security risks and the growing needs of the business has resulted in many IT teams straining to deliver, let alone provide innovation and improvements, Ember said. Business managers cannot afford to rely on internal IT service areas to deliver the applications and platforms they need to get the job done.</p>

          <p>Businesses need a network that can empower the data center to move workloads to the cloud. In most data centers, the diverse and disjointed visibility, as well as troubleshooting capabilities with no correlation across different environments, results in complex operational models. Cisco Cloud Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI)automates the management of end-to-end connectivity as well as the enforcement of consistent security policies for applications running in on-premises data centers and on AWS.</p>

          <p>At Aledade, we perform ETL on the healthcare data of millions of patients from thousands of different sources, and the primary tool we leverage is the workflow management tool Airflow. Because the amount of data we process is growing exponentially, we have quickly outgrown the ability to scale our dockerized Airflow deploy horizontally. We decided to move Airflow into Kubernetes to take advantage of their native support for scaling pods up and down, as needed, to handle tasks. With zero experience running a Kubernetes cluster, EKS allowed us to get up and running rapidly. Here is how we did it.</p>

          <p>Many organizations have developed a cloud-migration strategy and are looking at how to accelerate cloud adoption. As organizations increasingly embrace IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS consumption models, many select Amazon Web Services (AWS) as their cloud provider. While pre-application migration planning and application readiness is a key focus area, many organizations realized that network readiness is critical for a successful cloud adoption journey. Legacy network architectures lack the simplicity, adaptability, automation, and application awareness needed to deliver the best user experience. A cloud-ready network should enable secure and optimized connectivity to cloud services from remote locations.</p>

          <p>June 1st marks the official start of Hurricane Season. This time of year brings strong winds and powerful lessons in preparedness. To support our customers, the AWS Disaster Response Program provides a set of services that enables the disaster response community to easily leverage the benefits of AWS during disasters whether it is a typhoon, earthquake, or fire. With the AWS Disaster Response Program, governments and nonprofit organizations worldwide can take advantage of technologies and expertise to tap into the on-demand infrastructure of AWS at the edge and in the cloud for resiliency planning and disaster response like architecting a business continuity plan built in the cloud to ensure continuity of government, or like spinning up a virtual call center that expands on demand and staffing it with volunteers and deprovisioning the service as soon as demand subsides, or like leveraging Amazon SageMaker to more rapidly analyze geospatial data to assess damage.</p>

Perhaps unsurprisingly, entrepreneurial enthusiasm isnt hard to come by in Europe, and neither are up-and-coming folks with promising ideas.</p>
