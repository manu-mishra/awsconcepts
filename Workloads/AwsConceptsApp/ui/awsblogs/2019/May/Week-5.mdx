This library has predefined templates for parsing and optimizing the most popular log formats. The library provides a mechanism for defining schemas, managing partitions, and transforming data within an extract, transform, load (ETL) job in AWS Glue. AWS Glue is a serverless data transformation and cataloging service. You can use this library in conjunction with AWS Glue ETL jobs to enable a common framework for processing log data.</p>

          <p>At Aledade, we perform ETL on the healthcare data of millions of patients from thousands of different sources, and the primary tool we leverage is the workflow management tool Airflow. Because the amount of data we process is growing exponentially, we have quickly outgrown the ability to scale our dockerized Airflow deploy horizontally. We decided to move Airflow into Kubernetes to take advantage of their native support for scaling pods up and down, as needed, to handle tasks. With zero experience running a Kubernetes cluster, EKS allowed us to get up and running rapidly. Here is how we did it.</p>

          <p>Many organizations have developed a cloud-migration strategy and are looking at how to accelerate cloud adoption. As organizations increasingly embrace IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS consumption models, many select Amazon Web Services (AWS) as their cloud provider. While pre-application migration planning and application readiness is a key focus area, many organizations realized that network readiness is critical for a successful cloud adoption journey. Legacy network architectures lack the simplicity, adaptability, automation, and application awareness needed to deliver the best user experience. A cloud-ready network should enable secure and optimized connectivity to cloud services from remote locations.</p>

The European Union has adopted a brighter attitude toward startups as venture capital funds in the region have matured and investments have soared. Perhaps unsurprisingly, entrepreneurial enthusiasm isnt hard to come by in Europe, and neither are up-and-coming folks with promising ideas.</p>
