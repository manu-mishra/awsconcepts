          <p>While fashion is sometimes seen as rarified and impenetrable, the reality is that most people engage with it on a daily basis.

          <p>Oceans are made for exploration. That seems to be the subtext of the evocatively named Datameer, which uses Meer, the German word for ocean, to position itself in juxtaposition with data lakes. The name Datameer hints at the immensity and power of data, which shapes lives today in much the same way that ocean currents shaped those in previous centuries. It also hints at the sheer inscrutability of data. For most people, being presented with raw data and asked to interpret it is as bewildering as being presented with a view of a flat sea and told to list statistics about local fish populations. Thats where Datameer comes in.</p>
