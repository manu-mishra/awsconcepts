          <p>The mission of the Allen Institute for Brain Science is to accelerate our understanding of how the human brain works in health and disease. As part of this mission, scientists collect massive amounts of data, which is publicly released to help accelerate research in the field of neuroscience. Massive datasets can be challenging to share, so the Allen Institute uses AWS to share them around the world.</p>

          <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) and cloud infrastructure have altered the dynamic between business units and the IT department. According to Julie Ember, SaaS transition specialist at TechnologyOne, IT professionals are facing ever-increasing demands for the services they provide to businesses. The complexity of IT environments, the rate of change, the cost pressures, the increasing security risks and the growing needs of the business has resulted in many IT teams straining to deliver, let alone provide innovation and improvements, Ember said. Business managers cannot afford to rely on internal IT service areas to deliver the applications and platforms they need to get the job done.</p>
