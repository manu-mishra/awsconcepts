          <p>In a SaaS environment, the compute, storage, and bandwidth resources are often shared among tenants, but this makes it challenging to deduce per tenant cost. A SaaS application running on a Kubernetes cluster on AWS adds a layer of further complexity as far as calculating the per tenant cost. Kubernetes is great at abstracting away the underlying pool of hardware. It almost gives us an illusion of having access to a single large compute resource.</p>

          <p>Automatic software patching is not yet seen as a security benefit, even though out-of-date software is the cause of many recent cybersecurity failures. As companies and their staff become more security-aware and, in some cases, legally accountable for security breaches, system administrators are starting to see automated Linux kernel live patching as the missing link in their system security profiles. Despite the disadvantages, a system with live patching is safer than one without.</p>

          <p>On April 8, Amazon ES launched support for event monitoring and alerting. To use this feature, you work with monitors&#8212;scheduled jobs&#8212;that have triggers, which are specific conditions that you set, telling the monitor when it should send an alert. An alert is a notification that the triggering condition occurred. When a trigger fires, the monitor takes action, sending a message to your destination.
