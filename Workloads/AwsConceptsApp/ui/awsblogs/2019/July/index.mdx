The speed of transformation will also impact Italys growth and the international competitiveness of Italian companies. The study by the Institute for Competitiveness analyzes policies that are being implemented to enable Italy to achieve the targets set by the European Digital Agenda and to speed up cloud adoption.</p>

          <p>The University of Nottingham has a history dating back to 1881, and while the university is now global with campuses in China and Malaysia, its flagship campus remains in the UK. Today, the universitys research efforts span nearly every discipline. One current project is Crossbow, a new, open source software project conceived and developed by Dr. Christian Suess, a research fellow at The University of Nottingham in conjunction with principal investigator Prof. Charlie Laughton, professor of computational pharmaceutical science. Crossbow is based out of the school of pharmacy at the University of Nottingham, where there is a particular interest in researching the design of new medicines using computer simulations of drugs and proteins.</p>

          <p>Rewriting an application code for performance optimization generally requires a significant amount of effort. Also, IT and development groups using third-party applications like Tableau may not have access to the application code. Heimdalls database proxy solution offers a flexible and cost-effective alternative to rewriting your application for performance and scale. Heimdall transparently provides SQL control and visibility to the application owner without (re)writing a single line of code.</p>

          <p>In a SaaS environment, the compute, storage, and bandwidth resources are often shared among tenants, but this makes it challenging to deduce per tenant cost. A SaaS application running on a Kubernetes cluster on AWS adds a layer of further complexity as far as calculating the per tenant cost. Kubernetes is great at abstracting away the underlying pool of hardware. It almost gives us an illusion of having access to a single large compute resource.</p>

Despite the disadvantages, a system with live patching is safer than one without.</p>

To use this feature, you work with monitorsscheduled jobsthat have triggers, which are specific conditions that you set, telling the monitor when it should send an alert. An alert is a notification that the triggering condition occurred. When a trigger fires, the monitor takes action, sending a message to your destination.

          <p>Hiring the right people for your startup is one of the most important things that you will do as a founder. Beyond finding product/market fit, its probably the most important thing that youll do. Before joining AWS, Id interviewed and hired a bunch of people as the CEO and Co-Founder of the live event startup Shortcut. Amazon, however, is the only employer that has actually taught and trained me how to properly interview and hire. Id now like to share some of those lessons here because I think they are critical and particularly applicable to startups.</p>

          <p>Alcohol, in addition to being one of the largest revenue drivers in retail, is also one of the most highly regulated industries in the country, with restrictions that vary from state to state. These varying restrictions make alcohol difficult to sell via apps, resulting in missed sales opportunities for retailers. Thats where BYBE comes in.</p>

          <p>Many companies or institutions still possess legacy non-x86 systems in their datacenters: mainframe, midrange, or UNIX proprietary systems. Migrating these workloads across hardware architectures to the AWS Cloud requires advanced software technology. Short-term migration approaches mainly use hardware emulation, middleware emulation, automated refactoring, or middleware replatforming. This post highlights short-term migration options, their key technical differences, as well as their differentiated benefits.</p>

Cluster Mode comes with the primary benefit of horizontal scaling up and down of your Redis cluster, with almost zero impact on the performance of the cluster, as I will demonstrate later. If you have ever encountered a Redis cluster that is over or under-provisioned or just want to better understand its inner workings, please read on.</p>
