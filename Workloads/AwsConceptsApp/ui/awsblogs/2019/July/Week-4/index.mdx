They recently introduced a feature called DevOps as Code, which makes it even easier to migrate applications to Amazon EKS infrastructure.</p>

Cluster Mode comes with the primary benefit of horizontal scaling up and down of your Redis cluster, with almost zero impact on the performance of the cluster, as I will demonstrate later.
