          <p>Hiring the right people for your startup is one of the most important things that you will do as a founder. Beyond finding product/market fit, its probably the most important thing that youll do. Before joining AWS, Id interviewed and hired a bunch of people as the CEO and Co-Founder of the live event startup Shortcut. Amazon, however, is the only employer that has actually taught and trained me how to properly interview and hire. Id now like to share some of those lessons here because I think they are critical and particularly applicable to startups.</p>

          <p>Alcohol, in addition to being one of the largest revenue drivers in retail, is also one of the most highly regulated industries in the country, with restrictions that vary from state to state. These varying restrictions make alcohol difficult to sell via apps, resulting in missed sales opportunities for retailers. Thats where BYBE comes in.</p>

          <p>Many companies or institutions still possess legacy non-x86 systems in their datacenters: mainframe, midrange, or UNIX proprietary systems. Migrating these workloads across hardware architectures to the AWS Cloud requires advanced software technology. Short-term migration approaches mainly use hardware emulation, middleware emulation, automated refactoring, or middleware replatforming. This post highlights short-term migration options, their key technical differences, as well as their differentiated benefits.</p>
