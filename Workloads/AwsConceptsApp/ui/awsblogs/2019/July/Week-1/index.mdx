          <p>Digital transformation is changing the modus operandi of organizations both in the public and private sector. This is also the case for Italy, that is still lagging behind more advanced countries. The speed of transformation will also impact Italys growth and the international competitiveness of Italian companies. The study by the Institute for Competitiveness analyzes policies that are being implemented to enable Italy to achieve the targets set by the European Digital Agenda and to speed up cloud adoption.</p>
