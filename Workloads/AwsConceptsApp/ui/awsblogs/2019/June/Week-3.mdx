          <p>The earth is breathing, the earth is speaking, but are we listening? said Dr. Dava Newman, Apollo Program Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). From the warming of Earth over the decades to the resulting melting of the Greenland ice shelf (which can correspond to a 6-meter rise in sea levels), the Earths vital signs are real. But we need to understand the Earth to save it, said Lori Garver, CEO of Earthrise Alliance. What can we all do to address these issues?</p>

          <p>Given the global ubiquity of social media and our ever-interconnected virtual experiences, it might be easy to assume, when thinking about building a platforms user base, that universal goals are always best. That may be the case for certain sectors, but crowdfunding is a different animal. As a crowdfunding platform specifically tailored to the giving needs and patterns of Indonesians, Kitabisa understands that.</p>

Here, we take an in-depth analysis of the architecture and performance characteristics of a completely serverless data processing platform. While the approach isnt applicable for every use case, it has a very low total cost of ownership (TCO) and because AWS Lambda allows us to run arbitrary code easily, this approach provides the flexibility to handle non-standard data formats easily.</p>
