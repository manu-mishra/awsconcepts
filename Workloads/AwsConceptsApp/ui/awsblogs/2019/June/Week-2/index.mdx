          <p>Are you stuck in your colocation facility spending precious dollars on maintaining hardware instead of innovating? Well, you are not alone. In the decade plus since Amazon Web Services (AWS) released the first cloud services, organizations around the world are seeing the benefits of letting others run their IT infrastructure so that they can get to business making their apps great. However, when considering a cloud migration, many organizations struggle with how to get started, and often these organizations allow the complexity of a cloud migration to be a barrier to building a migration strategy and roadmap.</p>

          <p>AWS Premier Partner Apps Associates, an industry leader for migrating and managing Oracle workloads to the cloud, recently conducted an independent survey of more than 300 Oracle application customers to uncover what&#8217;s holding IT decision makers (ITDMs) back from moving their Oracle apps to the cloud. The study uncovered several myths that many ITDMs still believe to be true, although many of these myths have since been debunked&#8212;not by declaration but by repeatable, proven success.</p>

          <p>For entrepreneurs, the importance of product-market fit has become conventional wisdom. Selling the right product to a strong market that really wants it is a cornerstone for growth. But startups and investors are increasingly focusing on a different kind of compatibility: founder-market fit. You may have a great product for a strong market &#8212; but are you the right person to build the company? Maybe the most obvious element of founder-market fit is based on experience. It&#8217;s essential to have founders with the right kind of skills and background to match the market.</p>
