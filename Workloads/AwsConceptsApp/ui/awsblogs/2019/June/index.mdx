          <p>Are you stuck in your colocation facility spending precious dollars on maintaining hardware instead of innovating? Well, you are not alone. In the decade plus since Amazon Web Services (AWS) released the first cloud services, organizations around the world are seeing the benefits of letting others run their IT infrastructure so that they can get to business making their apps great. However, when considering a cloud migration, many organizations struggle with how to get started, and often these organizations allow the complexity of a cloud migration to be a barrier to building a migration strategy and roadmap.</p>

          <p>AWS Premier Partner Apps Associates, an industry leader for migrating and managing Oracle workloads to the cloud, recently conducted an independent survey of more than 300 Oracle application customers to uncover whats holding IT decision makers (ITDMs) back from moving their Oracle apps to the cloud. The study uncovered several myths that many ITDMs still believe to be true, although many of these myths have since been debunkednot by declaration but by repeatable, proven success.</p>

          <p>For entrepreneurs, the importance of product-market fit has become conventional wisdom. Selling the right product to a strong market that really wants it is a cornerstone for growth. But startups and investors are increasingly focusing on a different kind of compatibility: founder-market fit. You may have a great product for a strong market but are you the right person to build the company? Maybe the most obvious element of founder-market fit is based on experience. Its essential to have founders with the right kind of skills and background to match the market.</p>

          <p>The earth is breathing, the earth is speaking, but are we listening? said Dr. Dava Newman, Apollo Program Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). From the warming of Earth over the decades to the resulting melting of the Greenland ice shelf (which can correspond to a 6-meter rise in sea levels), the Earths vital signs are real. But we need to understand the Earth to save it, said Lori Garver, CEO of Earthrise Alliance. What can we all do to address these issues?</p>

          <p>There are many tools available for doing large-scale data analysis, and picking the right one for a given job is critical. Here, we take an in-depth analysis of the architecture and performance characteristics of a completely serverless data processing platform. While the approach isnt applicable for every use case, it has a very low total cost of ownership (TCO) and because AWS Lambda allows us to run arbitrary code easily, this approach provides the flexibility to handle non-standard data formats easily.</p>

          <p>Datavant enables health companies to share sensitive health data securely. An important part of this process is de-identifying records so that they can be used in research or analytics contexts where identifying information is unneeded or required by law to be removed. Datavant supports both on-premise and cloud workflows to de-identify data. In this post, we share a simple approach to turn our native on-premise application into an AWS-hosted cloud service over the course of a single sprint cycle.</p>

          <p>The terrible headlines are all too familiar. A major earthquake strikes, with a devastating impact on lives, economies, and the environment. The initial event often triggers additional disasters, such as fires or tsunamis that unleash substantial damage. The 2004 Indian Ocean undersea earthquake spawned a tsunami that took more than 225,000 lives. More than 100,000 people were lost as a result of a 7.0 temblor in Haiti in 2010. In some cases, the impact of a major seismic event will continue for decades or longer, as weve seen in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster of 2011.</p>

          <p>As customers start to build their hybrid network architectures, they often ask us how they can leverage next-generation firewalls to protect their data in VMware Cloud on AWS similar to what they do in their native AWS environment or on-premises. Some of these customers already leverage APN solutions, or other firewall vendors and want to leverage the same partner solutions in their VMware Cloud on AWS environments. This post covers the design required to leverage a next-generation firewall with VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>

          <p>After reviewing many solutions, 3M HIS chose Amazon Redshift as the appropriate data warehouse solution. We concluded Amazon Redshift met our needs; a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse solution that uses columnar storage to minimize I/O, provides high data compression rates, and offers fast performance. We quickly spun up a cluster in our development environment, built out the dimensional model, loaded data, and made it available to perform benchmarking and testing of the user data. An extract, transform, load (ETL) tool was used to process and load the data from various sources into Amazon Redshift.</p>

          <p>Amazon EMR release 5.24.0 includes several optimizations in Spark that improve query performance. To evaluate the performance improvements, we used TPC-DS benchmark queries with 3-TB scale and ran them on a 6-node c4.8xlarge EMR cluster with data in Amazon S3. We observed up to 13X better query performance on EMR 5.24 compared to EMR 5.16 when operating with a similar configuration.</p>

          <p>Countless popular websites maintained by public institutions including whitehouse.gov and PMIndia.gov are built on the WordPress platform. Its essential that these sites are highly scalable. Amazon Lightsail helps ensure that they can handle high-traffic situations. These sites often require on-demand scaling during high-traffic spikes, for example, when media coverage mentions government websites or an educational institution is registering during admissions season. Given these requirements, if the website isnt set up properly, the features that make WordPress popular for public websites can sometimes become a challenge to manage.</p>

          <p>Scientists at NC State Universitys North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies (NCICS) work with large datasets and complex computational analysis. Traditionally, they did their work using on-premises computational resources. As different projects were stretching the limits of those systems, NCICS decided to explore cloud computing. As part of the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative, we invited Jessica Mathews, Jared Rennie, and Tom Maycock to share what they learned from using AWS for climate research. As they considered exploring the cloud to support their work, the idea of leaving the comfort of the local environment was a bit scary. And they had questions: How much will it cost? What does it take to deploy processing to the cloud? Will it be faster? Will the results match what they were getting with their own systems? Here is their story and what they learned.</p>
