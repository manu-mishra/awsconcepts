          <p>Every year, students across the U.S. and around the globe begin preparing for college entrance exams. These tests are a key component of any student&#8217;s application to college. The ACT, a nonprofit organization that administers the ACT test, wanted to make the process of researching, studying for, and taking the ACT less stressful for students and parents. Today, they are announcing a new Alexa skill that helps guide high school students through the process of preparing for and taking the ACT.</p>

          <p>The terrible headlines are all too familiar. A major earthquake strikes, with a devastating impact on lives, economies, and the environment. The initial event often triggers additional disasters, such as fires or tsunamis that unleash substantial damage. The 2004 Indian Ocean undersea earthquake spawned a tsunami that took more than 225,000 lives. More than 100,000 people were lost as a result of a 7.0 temblor in Haiti in 2010. In some cases, the impact of a major seismic event will continue for decades or longer, as we&#8217;ve seen in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster of 2011.</p>

          <p>As customers start to build their hybrid network architectures, they often ask us how they can leverage next-generation firewalls to protect their data in VMware Cloud on AWS similar to what they do in their native AWS environment or on-premises. Some of these customers already leverage APN solutions, or other firewall vendors and want to leverage the same partner solutions in their VMware Cloud on AWS environments. This post covers the design required to leverage a next-generation firewall with VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>

          <p>After reviewing many solutions, 3M HIS chose Amazon Redshift as the appropriate data warehouse solution. We concluded Amazon Redshift met our needs; a fast, fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse solution that uses columnar storage to minimize I/O, provides high data compression rates, and offers fast performance. We quickly spun up a cluster in our development environment, built out the dimensional model, loaded data, and made it available to perform benchmarking and testing of the user data. An extract, transform, load (ETL) tool was used to process and load the data from various sources into Amazon Redshift.</p>

          <p>Today, AWS is excited to announce the availability of fine-grained access control for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)-permissioned resources in Amazon QuickSight. Fine-grained access control allows Amazon QuickSight account administrators to control authors&#8217; default access to connected AWS resources. Fine-grained access control enables administrators to use IAM policies to scope down access permissions, limiting specific authors&#8217; access to specific items within the AWS resources. Administrators can now apply this new level of access control to Amazon S3, Amazon Athena, and Amazon RDS/Redshift database discovery.</p>
