          <p>Amazon EMR release 5.24.0 includes several optimizations in Spark that improve query performance. To evaluate the performance improvements, we used TPC-DS benchmark queries with 3-TB scale and ran them on a 6-node c4.8xlarge EMR cluster with data in Amazon S3. We observed up to 13X better query performance on EMR 5.24 compared to EMR 5.16 when operating with a similar configuration.</p>

It can give you answers to important questions, but it doesnt have the power to prevent a negative event. But what if those black boxes could analyze the data they collected in real time, predict future events, and deploy an intervention before an accident happened?</p>

Its essential that these sites are highly scalable. Amazon Lightsail helps ensure that they can handle high-traffic situations. These sites often require on-demand scaling during high-traffic spikes, for example, when media coverage mentions government websites or an educational institution is registering during admissions season. Given these requirements, if the website isnt set up properly, the features that make WordPress popular for public websites can sometimes become a challenge to manage.</p>

          <p>Scientists at NC State Universitys North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies (NCICS) work with large datasets and complex computational analysis. Traditionally, they did their work using on-premises computational resources. As different projects were stretching the limits of those systems, NCICS decided to explore cloud computing. As part of the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative, we invited Jessica Mathews, Jared Rennie, and Tom Maycock to share what they learned from using AWS for climate research. As they considered exploring the cloud to support their work, the idea of leaving the comfort of the local environment was a bit scary. And they had questions: How much will it cost? What does it take to deploy processing to the cloud? Will it be faster? Will the results match what they were getting with their own systems? Here is their story and what they learned.</p>
