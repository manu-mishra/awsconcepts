          <p>Business technology may be growing increasingly complex, but when it comes to cybersecurity, it remains a game of cat and mouse. Hackers and cyber criminals are currently creating malware at an unprecedented level to infiltrate websites around the world, disrupt business, steal company secrets, shut down sites, and take customers information. In 2017 alone, over 120 million new malware samples were detected. And even if your business deploys state-of-the-art signature-based detection systems and malware sandboxing, it can quickly get overwhelmed by a daily deluge of new threats. Sunnyvale, Calif-based Blue Hexagon, however, thinks its cracked the problem. </p>

Like many charities, the BHF is entirely reliant on the publics generosity to fund its lifesaving research and receives no government funding. With around seven million people in the UK living with heart and circulatory diseases, all participants have made a valuable investment to the cause.</p>
