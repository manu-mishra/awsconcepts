Then learn how this communication can be analyzed using Percepio Tracealyzer, ensuring your system doesn&#8217;t generate unnecessary data traffic. We&#8217;ll present an example where two minor bugs sometimes coincided, causing the system to generate 10 times more data than expected, and how the cause of such issues can be identified.</p>
