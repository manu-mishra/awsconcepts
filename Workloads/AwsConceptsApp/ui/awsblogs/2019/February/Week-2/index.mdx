          <p>Business technology may be growing increasingly complex, but when it comes to cybersecurity, it remains a game of cat and mouse. Hackers and cyber criminals are currently creating malware at an unprecedented level to infiltrate websites around the world, disrupt business, steal company secrets, shut down sites, and take customers&#8217; information. In 2017 alone, over 120 million new malware samples were detected. And even if your business deploys state-of-the-art signature-based detection systems and malware sandboxing, it can quickly get overwhelmed by a daily deluge of new threats. Sunnyvale, Calif-based Blue Hexagon, however, thinks it&#8217;s cracked the problem. &#160;</p>
