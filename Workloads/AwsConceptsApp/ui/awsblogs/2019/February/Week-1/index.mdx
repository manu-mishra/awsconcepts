          <p>Although more customers every day are using AWS to build, run and gain insights from data lakes, the journey to a data lake for many organizations can be one of uncertainty, and a path that may even seem too difficult to attempt. In this blog, we will discuss the challenges organizations can face with siloed data and how data from disparate systems can be brought together using data domains.</p>

          <p>The concept of a Managed Service Provider (MSP) isn&#8217;t necessarily new, but it can be difficult for organizations to grasp. What does it take to become a next-generation MSP? How does an organization begin that process on AWS? At a high level, a next-gen MSP educates customers on a proactive, ongoing basis; leads with AWS Professional Services; and advocates&#160;to customers the use of and evolution of AWS services. In this post, explore why you should care about next-gen MSPs and what&#8217;s in it for your organization.</p>
