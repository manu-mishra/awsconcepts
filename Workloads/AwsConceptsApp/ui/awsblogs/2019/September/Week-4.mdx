          <p>At the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Public Sector Summit in Washington, DC, AWS employees shared and demonstrated our newest homegrown AWS innovations in the AWS Builders Fair. These demos featured real-world use cases for government, education, and nonprofits. Using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), natural language processing, and robotics, the demos show how technology can help address issues from recycling to translation to safe transportation. Check out the top six Builders Fair demos, now on our YouTube channel.</p>
