          <p>Being able to access files via standard file protocols from one or more locations is important to many organizations. With Nasuni, all data is stored on Amazon S3, enabling customers to have access to their data anywhere over standard file protocols using many of the NAS features theyre used to at local performance, without having to maintain full replicas of the data in each location. Nasuni also has a control plane running on AWS that enables functionality such as global file locking.</p>
