          <p>Perimeter security helps secure Apache Hadoop cluster resources to users accessing from outside the cluster. It enables a single access point for all REST and HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters and simplifies client interaction with the cluster. For example, client applications must acquire Kerberos tickets using Kinit or SPNEGO before interacting with services on Kerberos enabled clusters. In this post, we walk through setup of Apache Knox to enable perimeter security for EMR clusters.</p>

          <p>As communities around the world grow, traffic congestion problems increase. Cities and states in addition to regional authorities face decisions around how to modernize, maintain, and budget for upgrades to their transportation network to improve the quality of life and safety of their residents. With private and public sector collaboration, officials can measure and analyze city transportation and congestion to make data-driven decisions that improve the quality of life for their residents.</p>

          <p>Horizontally scaling a SQL database involves separating the write-master from read-only servers. This allows the write server to perform dedicated write operations rather than processing redundant read queries. However, writing to one node and reading from another can result in inconsistent data due to synchronization delays. Heimdall Data offers a database proxy to help developers and architects achieve optimal scale from theirAmazon RDS andAmazon Auroraenvironment without any application changes.</p>

          <p>Sharing data publicly helps accelerate innovation by increasing the number of people who can perform research and derive insights from it. When data is shared in the cloud, researchers are able to work with data without needing to download or store their own copies. This allows users to start analyzing massive amounts of data in minutes, regardless of their location, local storage space availability, or computing capacity. Through the AWS Public Dataset Program, we collaborate with AWS customers to explore the best ways to stage data for analysis in the cloud.</p>
