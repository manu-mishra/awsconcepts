          <p>Oil and gas operators are feeling the pinch. &#8220;Their wells are underperforming, so they can&#8217;t get enough oil out of the ground and they are missing financial forecasts,&#8221; says Josh Ulla, Chief Development Officer at Deep Imaging. Analytics are the life blood of the business world, but they haven&#8217;t yet taken a strong hold in the energy industry. That&#8217;s where startups like Deep Imaging Technologies come in.</p>

          <p>With the addition of WebSocket support in Amazon API Gateway, we set out to build an AWS CloudFormation template to get the simplest WebSocket version. What we built was backed by an&#160;AWS Lambda function that responds directly to the client who initiated the request. We learned quite a few things along the way, and even ended up with an easy solution in Stackery for managing and deploying one of these simple WebSockets.</p>

          <p>One of the U.S. Intelligence Community&#8217;s biggest events is the annual Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) Conference. In August, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) brought together over 3,700 experts and innovators from government and industry at DoDIIS to share their insights on this year&#8217;s conference theme - Resiliency, Redundancy and Security: Adapting to Asymmetric Threats. For years, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has helped the federal government harness the power of the cloud to transform its mission and create a better world by enabling rapid sourcing, enrichment, and analysis of massive amounts of global data to reveal insight and actionable intelligence.</p>

          <p>Time series forecasting is a common customer need. Amazon Forecast&#160;accelerates this and is based on the same technology used at Amazon.com. This new service massively reduces the effort required to automate data updating and model retraining, and it manages this while retaining the granularity of control that data scientists will appreciate and utilize. This post explores the use of this new service for energy consumption forecasting.</p>

          <p>After you&#8217;ve trained and exported a TensorFlow model, you can use Amazon SageMaker to perform inferences using your model. You can either: Deploy your model to an endpoint to obtain real-time inferences from your model. Use batch transform to obtain inferences on an entire dataset stored in Amazon S3. In the case of batch transform, [...]</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is currently migrating their systems to a cloud architecture. Mason McDaniel, chief technology officer at ATF, spoke with Government Matters at the AWS Public Sector Summit in Washington, DC about the status of their current cloud migration efforts. Watch the full interview with Mason McDaniel to learn more about ATF&#8217;s cloud migration strategy, the importance of automation, and how IT modernization helped them modernize their mission.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Disruptive Innovators Network (DIN) hosted the first competitive social housing hackathon this past May in London. Four UK housing associations - including Great Places, Places for People and Metropolitan Thames Valley - were teamed with members of the AWS Partner Network (APN), and had 36 hours to analyse one of four housing problems and hack a solution.</p>

          <p>Perimeter security helps secure Apache Hadoop cluster resources to users accessing from outside the cluster. It enables a single access point for all REST and HTTP interactions with Apache Hadoop clusters and simplifies client interaction with the cluster. For example, client applications must acquire Kerberos tickets using Kinit or SPNEGO before interacting with services on Kerberos enabled clusters. In this post, we walk through setup of Apache Knox to enable perimeter security for EMR clusters.</p>
