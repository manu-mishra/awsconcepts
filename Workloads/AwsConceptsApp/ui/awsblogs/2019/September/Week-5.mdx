          <p>Sharing data publicly helps accelerate innovation by increasing the number of people who can perform research and derive insights from it. When data is shared in the cloud, researchers are able to work with data without needing to download or store their own copies. This allows users to start analyzing massive amounts of data in minutes, regardless of their location, local storage space availability, or computing capacity. Through the AWS Public Dataset Program, we collaborate with AWS customers to explore the best ways to stage data for analysis in the cloud.</p>
