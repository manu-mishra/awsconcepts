          <p>Each year since 1978, thousands of financial services executives and thought leaders gather at Sibos, the largest industry conference focused on emerging technology trends. Sibos will take place September 23-26, 2019, moving to London for the first time, in honor of the citys central role in the global financial services ecosystem. In the spirit of the conference theme, thriving in a hyper-connected world, Amazon Web Services (AWS) will join Sibos to help attendees differentiate technologies that drive long-term business value from short-lived trends, and discover growth opportunities from new platforms and operating models.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been running Windows workloads for eleven years, and runs nearly twice as many Windows Server instances than any other cloud provider. And with seven times fewer downtime hours in 2018 than the next largest cloud provider*, AWS is the right choice for Microsoft workloads and most any other IT workload. Dive deep and learn more about Microsoft workloads on AWS by checking out some of AWS Public Sector Summit on-demand conference sessions and technical presentations given by AWS solutions architects this June in Washington, DC.</p>

          <p>Horizontally scaling a SQL database involves separating the write-master from read-only servers. This allows the write server to perform dedicated write operations rather than processing redundant read queries. However, writing to one node and reading from another can result in inconsistent data due to synchronization delays. Heimdall Data offers a database proxy to help developers and architects achieve optimal scale from theirAmazon RDS andAmazon Auroraenvironment without any application changes.</p>
