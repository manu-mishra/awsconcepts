          <p>Francis Shanahan has developed Zuggest, a novel approach to searching the Amazon catalog. Simply enter your query, and Zuggest will make a call to ECS every couple of seconds and update the display accordingly.

          <p>The XML Shell allows command-line users to interactively query and manipulate XML data without writing any code. Written in Perl, the tool allows you to use a combination of Perl and XPath syntax to treat XML data structures as if they were genuine Perl objects. You can also navigate through the XML data hierarchy using [...]</p>
