          <p>Thom Wetzel sent me information about his new site, the Wishlist Buddy. As Thom notes: Ive noticed that a lot of the times with books, DVDs and video games, the prices usually start out high and work their way down to less than half price over time.

Werner is Amazons CTO and the author of the All Things Distributed blog. Werner goes into considerable detail on the inner workings of the Amazon site, scalability issues, our internal services architecture, and [...]</p>

          <p>Its VHS vs. Beta, all over again! Back when I was young, there were two main consumer video tape formats, VHS and Beta.

VHS ultimately prevailed, to the extent that many of todays youngest consumers dont [...]</p>

          <p>Last week I did an AWS presentation at Westminster University. The audience was very lively and asked a number of great questions. They also wrote some nice blog posts.
