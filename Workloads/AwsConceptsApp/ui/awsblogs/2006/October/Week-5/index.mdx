          <p>Important Update: There seems to be some confusion about the creator of Flowser - I&#8217;ve seen a couple of blog posts which claimed that Amazon created it. In fact, a creative member of our developer community created it and he deserves all of the credit! &nbsp; This past weekend I snuck a peak at the [...]</p>
