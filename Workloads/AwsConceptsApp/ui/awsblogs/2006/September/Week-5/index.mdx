          <p>The Jets3t Cockpit is a graphical Java application for viewing and modifying the contents of an Amazon S3 account. Using the Applet, it is very easy to view the objects and buckets in the S3 account, upload new data to S3, and to download existing data to the desktop. Here&#8217;s what it looks like: There&#8217;s [...]</p>

          <p>The response to the beta rollout of the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was excellent. Many developers signed up and were able to start creating their scalable, on-demand applications. However, the product is still in beta and not everyone was able to get in. Everyone on the team has been besieged with emails from people [...]</p>

          <p>Earlier today, Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos gave the keynote presentation at the MIT Tech Review&#8217;s Emerging Technologies Conference. The conference was held on the MIT campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There were two distinct parts to Jeff&#8217;s talk. In the first part, Jeff made sure that the audience knew the basic financial and numerical facts about [...]</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos&#8217; talk earlier this week received a considerable amount of great coverage online. Here&#8217;s a sampling: The Motley Fool says that Amazon Looks to Make a Buck off Muck. Describing Amazon S3 and the Amazon Elastic Cloud, they said: &#8220;What this means in more practical terms is that if a small business suddenly needs [...]</p>

The attendees are often personally motivated to learn something new, and the Q&amp;A is typically extensive. We&#8217;ve recently added three new evangelists to our team &#8212; one in Japan and two in the United States. Our new [...]</p>

          <p>Minutes ago we rolled out a major upgrade to the Amazon Web Services Resource Center.

There are also &#8220;go-to&#8221; buttons [...]</p>
