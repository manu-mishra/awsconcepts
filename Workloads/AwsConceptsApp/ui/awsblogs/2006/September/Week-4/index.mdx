          <p>Earlier this week I was trying (and failing miserably) to explain an idea to a co-worker. I promised to clear up my thoughts and to encapsulate them in a blog post, so here goes.

Theres a Code Samples section for each of our services. Some services (e.g. Amazon S3) have several pages of useful samples. Second, check out the Krugle.com code [...]</p>
