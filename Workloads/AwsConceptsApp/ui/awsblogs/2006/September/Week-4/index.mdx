          <p>Earlier this week I was trying (and failing miserably) to explain an idea to a co-worker. I promised to clear up my thoughts and to encapsulate them in a blog post, so here goes. In a nutshell, if you take a peek behind the scenes at a web site, you will find a highly configurable [...]</p>

          <p>If you are trying to use AWS and need a code snippet or two, I&#8217;ve got a couple of suggestions for you. First, check out our Resource Center. There&#8217;s a Code Samples section for each of our services. Some services (e.g. Amazon S3) have several pages of useful samples. Second, check out the Krugle.com code [...]</p>

          <p>I&#8217;m just about to head downstairs to give my talk to the IEEE International Conference on Web Services, so this will be a really short entry. First,&#160; Mamoon&#8217;s SOA&#160; Testing Blog reports on his use of Amazon EC2. This entire entry is worth reading, but here are a few tidbits: &#8220;I love the fact that [...]</p>

          <p>I was on a conference call yesterday and the topic of ways to store persistent data when using Amazon EC2 came up a couple of times. It would be really cool to have a persistent instance of a relational database like MySQL but there&#8217;s nothing like that around at the moment. An instance can have [...]</p>
