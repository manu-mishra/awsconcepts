          <p>&#160; I&#8217;m 2/3rds of the way through a trip that will take me to three cities in the UK and then on to Boston before returning home. Late last week I gave the keynote at the d.Construct conference in Brighton, and received quite a bit of nice blog coverage: Suw Charman was happy that I [...]</p>

          <p>Over the last couple of months I have been corresponding with Fred Parnon, CEO of Jnana. Fred&#8217;s company has built a software platform targeted at domain experts who don&#8217;t happen to be software developers. Using this platform, domain experts can built sophisticated rule-based systems to make &#8220;intelligent&#8221; decisions, check large data sets against complex sets [...]</p>

          <p>John over at Texsy sent me some information about his new advertising system. Texsy analyzes the page and inserts advertising links which popup on a mouse-over. The ads use content drawn from Amazon, Shopping.com, and eBay and include the appropriate associate or affiliate links from the content / product supplier. 20% of the links will [...]</p>

          <p>The newest release of ECS provides both an API and a set of RSS feeds to allow developers direct access to promotions. What are promotions? Glad you asked! Promotions are short-term special deals that help customers to make purchases sooner rather than later, and which allow merchants to provide more attractive offers in a competitive [...]</p>

          <p>My wife&#8217;s out of town and the kids are at a high school football game, so I&#8217;ll just blog a few things before stepping away from the keyboard for a bit: Amazon S3 storage tool filicio.us now offers a choice of payment models, simple (pay them) and advanced (pay Amazon).
