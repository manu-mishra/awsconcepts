          <p>There are some fascinating posts over at the ESV blog. ESV refers to the English Standard Version of the Bible.

          <p>The AWS Solutions Catalog is the place to go to find AWS-based solutions of all shapes and sizes. The catalog is organized both by audience &#8212; with sections for Amazon Associates, Developers, Businesses, Amazon Sellers, and Consumers &#8212; and by service, with one section for each of the eight Amazon Web Services.

          <p>Update (January 13, 2022) - Removed the links. The Distributed Systems Engineering team at Amazon now has a site of their own. You can learn about what they do and how they are organized, and you can also take a look at their job openings. &#8212; Jeff;</p>

          <p>Version 8.1 of the Interarchy File Transfer application for the Macintosh now allows files to be transferred in and out of Amazon S3. I&#8217;m definitely not up to date on happenings in the Mac world (the last one that I used had a main memory size measured in kilobytes), but this application looks really good [...]</p>

Among a number of interesting sessions today, the most interesting one consisted of 5-minute &#8220;lightning&#8221; demos. Each developer had just 5 minutes to get up on stage, present his application, and answer questions. Bryan Wood showed off Lendmonkey.com. Bryan explained to the crowd [...]</p>
