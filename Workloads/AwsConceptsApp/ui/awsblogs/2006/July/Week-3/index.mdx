          <p>I am attending Mashup University today, but it is only a coincidence that today&#8217;s cool site is itself a mashup! Top City Books combines ECS data, Google Maps, and Yahoo Geocoding to display the top books sold in cities around the world. Geocoding refers to the process of turning a full or partial street address [...]</p>

Available in Home, Professional, and Client editions, Cardbox lets users design their own databases without the assistance of a DBA (database administrator).

          <p>PEAR is a set of classes that simplify the process of writing PHP code by providing robust, high-level abstractions.
