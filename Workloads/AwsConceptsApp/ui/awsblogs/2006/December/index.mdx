          <p>A new release of ECS 4.0 was rolled out earlier today. There are two new features: A new response group, OfferListings, was added for all locales. This response group returns somewhat lighter version of the data provided by the Offers group. Data for the French locale now includes the French waste tax. Jeff;</p>

          <p>Jonathan Boutelle gave a talk about scalable web architectures at a Bar Camp in Bangalore. His talk focused on how he and his team built Slideshare, including their use of Amazon S3 and Ruby on Rails. Jonanthans blog post includes a copy of his presentation (stored in Slideshare, naturally enough) and a video of the [...]</p>
