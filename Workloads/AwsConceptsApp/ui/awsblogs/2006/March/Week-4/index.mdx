          <p>Every Amazon wishlist now has an associated&#160; RSS feed, as you can see in the picture at right. You can access the RSS via the standard orange button. The generated RSS makes use of Microsoft&#8217;s new Simple List Extensions.When used with an SLE-aware browser&#160; or news reader, these extensions allow the wishlist items to be [...]</p>

          <p>RSS is one of those fundamentally important technologies, something that we&#8217;ll look back on in 10 or 15 years and wonder how we got along without it. Every day I see another interesting use for RSS, and I don&#8217;t expect the rate of innovation to slow down any time soon. Today&#8217;s wonder is RSS Talker, [...]</p>

          <p>This interesting quote from Sam Newman over at Magpie Brain caught my eye: &#8220;Amazon S3 exists only for other services and applications.&#8221; Sam&#8217;s entire post is worth reading; I think he really captures the spirit behind&nbsp; S3. &#8212; Jeff;</p>

          <p>I met the founder of Mozes at Mashup Camp earlier this year. They just rolled out the beta version of their new service. To use Mozes, you simply send (or &#8220;text&#8221; as my kids would say) an SMS message to 66937. The message must start with the word &#8220;book&#8221;, a space, and&nbsp; then the 10-digit [...]</p>

          <p>There&#8217;s a lot going on with Amazon&#8217;s new S3 service; here&#8217;s a quick roundup of some of what I&#8217;ve seen in the last couple of days: Over at InfoWorld, Jon Udell proposes S3 as a piece of politically neutral architecture. Mitch Garnaat has created BitBucket, a set of Python scripts for S3 access. There&#8217;s even [...]</p>
