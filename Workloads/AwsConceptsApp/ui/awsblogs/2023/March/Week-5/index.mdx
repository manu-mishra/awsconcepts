          <p>As the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) begins to wind down, starting April 1, 2023, state Medicaid agencies (SMAs) will have one year to &#8220;unwind&#8221; temporary COVID-era changes and return to pre-pandemic ways of working. For nearly a year, AWS has supported SMAs with in-house Medicaid expertise to identify unwinding issues and develop solutions to address them. The top four concerns that SMAs have shared for unwinding are constituent outreach and engagement, staffing shortages, returned mail, and reporting capabilities. In this blog post, explore how AWS can help with automating returned mail to support members in keeping their coverage.</p>
