          <p>In 2020, the City of Canton, Ohio set out to build a better, safer, and more connected community. The city worked with government technology (GovTech) company Wi-Fiber, a network infrastructure provider using AWS Direct Connect. Wi-Fiber combined the City of Cantons wireless hardware, existing copper, and fiber, where available, to connect hundreds of installed devices alongside roadways, intersections, and buildings. In two years, Canton successfully intertwined its legacy infrastructure with Wi-Fibers technology to maximize efficacy and minimize cost.</p>

          <p>Why invest in a multi-account cloud foundation? Small and Medium Businesses (SMB) usually start with a single account when setting up their Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment. They typically want to get going quickly and maintain agility. Starting small and focusing on business needs, seems to make the most sense. However, even as a small [...]</p>

          <p>An integral component to most serverless architectures is AWS Lambda, the compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application without provisioning or managing servers. Fastly has extended its Next-Gen WAF to Lambda functions, supporting customers looking to embed additional layers of security into their serverless workloads. Fastlys Next-Gen WAF supports numerous other deployment scenarios including virtual machines, containers, and web servers.</p>

          <p>Online fraud has a widespread impact on businesses and requires an effective end-to-end strategy to detect and prevent new account fraud and account takeovers, and stop suspicious payment transactions. In this post, we show a serverless approach to detect online transaction fraud in near-real time. We show how you can apply this approach to various data streaming and event-driven architectures, depending on the desired outcome and actions to take to prevent fraud (such as alert the user about the fraud or flag the transaction for additional review).</p>
