          <p>As the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) begins to wind down, starting April 1, 2023, state Medicaid agencies (SMAs) will have one year to unwind temporary COVID-era changes and return to pre-pandemic ways of working. For nearly a year, AWS has supported SMAs with in-house Medicaid expertise to identify unwinding issues and develop solutions to address them. The top four concerns that SMAs have shared for unwinding are constituent outreach and engagement, staffing shortages, returned mail, and reporting capabilities. In this blog post, explore how AWS can help with automating returned mail to support members in keeping their coverage.</p>

          <p>Climate change is a significant factor in many health-related issues, from the increase of pest-related illness, to food scarcity, access to clean air and water, and beyond. Recognizing the power the cloud has to amplify technologies that mitigate many of these issues, AWS is sponsoring a new fellowship with Halcyon, a Washington, DC-based nonprofit supporting impact-driven startups. Designed for entrepreneurs seeking to build climate resilience across Latin America and the Caribbean, the Halcyon Climate Resilience Intensive Fellowship aims to combat the compounding effects of climate change on poverty, food insecurity, health disparities, and displacement.</p>

          <p>Local public health departments must notify public health agencies, like state health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), of reportable conditions. These departments receive various types of reports of healthcare conditions through email, in addition to more traditional methods such as mail, fax, or phone calls. Local health departments can dramatically reduce the time and costs associated with manually processing email attachments and improve processing efficiency using automation. In this blog post, learn how to create an automated email attachment ingestion, storage, and processing solution powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services from AWS.</p>
