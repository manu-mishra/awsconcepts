          <p>Introduction Recently, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) added support for local clusters on AWS Outposts racks. In a nutshell, this deployment option allows our customers to run the entire Kubernetes cluster (i.e., control plane and worker nodes) on AWS Outposts racks. The rationale behind this deployment option is often described as static stability. In [...]</p>

          <p>Each year, US federal, state, and local government agencies spend a significant part of their budgets on various social and safety net programs. Tens of millions of residents apply for these benefits every year. In these applications, documents—in various sources, formats, and layouts—are the primary tools for application assessment. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology can accelerate and simplify the application review process, improving both the case worker and applicant experience. Learn how public sector agencies can leverage AI offerings from AWS, like Amazon Textract and Amazon Comprehend, to process multiple documents in benefit application use cases in an intelligent document processing (IDP) workflow.</p>
