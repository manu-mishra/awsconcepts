Tens of millions of residents apply for these benefits every year. In these applications, documents&#8212;in various sources, formats, and layouts&#8212;are the primary tools for application assessment. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology can accelerate and simplify the application review process, improving both the case worker and applicant experience.

          <p>Welcome to our thought leadership spotlight, &#8220;The Evolving Role of the Startup CFO.&#8221; This series features perspectives from prominent players in the startup ecosystem. These blog posts tackle critical questions, including: What does the role of today&#8217;s startup CFO entail and how will it evolve over the lifecycle of a startup? How can we most effectively support CFOs as the cloud increases its dominance within the organization and balance sheet? And can the CFO better navigate&#8212;and ultimately enable&#8212;the relationship between technical leaders, CTOs, and engineering teams?
Leading our first spotlight is Jerry Chen, a veteran partner at Greylock Partners, a globally recognized venture capital firm.</p>
