          <p>According to a new economic impact study (EIS) from AWS, AWS has invested ZAR 15.6 billion through 2022 to meet customer demand for cloud computing services. Thousands of South African customers have used AWS technologies to transform their businesses and accelerate their innovation, agility, and cost savings since AWS launched the AWS Africa (Cape Town) Region in 2020. According to the EIS, AWS operations will add an estimated ZAR 68 billion more to South Africas GDP by 2029. AWSs investment impacts other parts of the South African economy as well, helping develop the next generation of workforce, digitally transform businesses, and promote sustainability throughout the country.</p>

          <p>Satellite communications (satcom) networks typically offer a rich set of performance metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth delivered by remote terminals on land, sea, or air. Customers can use performance metrics to detect network and terminal anomalies and identify trends to impact business outcomes. This walkthrough presents an approach using serverless resources from AWS to build satcom control plane analytics pipelines. The presented architecture transforms the data to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) of interest, renders them in business intelligence tools, and applies machine learning (ML) to flag unexpected SNR deviations.</p>
