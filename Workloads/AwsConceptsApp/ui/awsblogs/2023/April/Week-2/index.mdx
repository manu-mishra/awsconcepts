          <p>To ensure cloud infrastructure is compliant with organizational policies and regulatory requirements, many platform engineering teams are embedding the policy-as-code practice into their DevSecOps toolchain. Learn how to use Pulumi and its CrossGuard policy-as-code feature to ensure your infrastructure is compliant before it’s ever provisioned in AWS. We’ll also demonstrate how to define custom policies in Python, and how to create a reusable package of policies by storing them in AWS CodeArtifact.</p>

          <p>“Evolutionary Architectures” is a four-part blog series that shows how solution designs and decisions evolve as companies go through the different stages of the startups lifecycle. In this series, we follow the aptly named Example Startup whose idea is to create a “fantasy stock market” application, similar to fantasy sports leagues. They envision holding four “tournaments” over the course of a year. The second blog described how the startup started evolving their technical solutions while the founders were getting ready for fund raising. In part 3, we will see how Example Startup further progresses in maturing their tech stack and positioning themselves well for scale.</p>

To ensure existing ABC customers have sufficient time to experiment with this new pricing model, ABC will be free of charge to existing ABC users for 2 months (April and May, 2023). For new ABC customers, there will be a free trial of 2 months. The free tier begins when you assign an account to any billing group.</p>
