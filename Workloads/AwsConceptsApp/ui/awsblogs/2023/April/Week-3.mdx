          <p>Satellite communications (satcom) networks typically offer a rich set of performance metrics, such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bandwidth delivered by remote terminals on land, sea, or air. Customers can use performance metrics to detect network and terminal anomalies and identify trends to impact business outcomes. This walkthrough presents an approach using serverless resources from AWS to build satcom control plane analytics pipelines. The presented architecture transforms the data to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) of interest, renders them in business intelligence tools, and applies machine learning (ML) to flag unexpected SNR deviations.</p>
