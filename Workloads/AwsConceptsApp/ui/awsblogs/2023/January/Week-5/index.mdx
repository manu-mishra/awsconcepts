          <p>Improving the customer experience (CX) has emerged as an imperative for government agencies. In this blog post, learn an architecture pattern that public institutions can use to improve CX while building and deploying secure, resilient, and performant web applications that support sudden surges in demand for public services. This architecture pattern addresses the need of an example use case in which an agency must request information from thousands to millions of civilians, who may access a single-page application at similar times, and then sends email notifications to each civilian to confirm their activity.</p>

          <p>In this post, we analyze the results from our benchmark tests running a TPC-DS application on open-source Apache Spark and then on Amazon EMR 6.9, which comes with an optimized Spark runtime that is compatible with open-source Spark. We walk through a detailed cost analysis and finally provide step-by-step instructions to run the benchmark. With Amazon EMR 6.9.0, you can now run your Apache Spark 3.x applications faster and at lower cost without requiring any changes to your applications. In our performance benchmark tests, derived from TPC-DS performance tests at 3 TB scale, we found the EMR runtime for Apache Spark 3.3.0 provides a 3.5 times (using total runtime) performance improvement on average over open-source Apache Spark 3.3.0.</p>
