          <p>Introduction Dynamically verifiable device identity is a foundational component of a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA). Ongoing dynamic evaluation of identity and trust requires complete and timely visibility into relevant components of that identity. Active device certificates issued by a revoked intermediate Certificate Authority (CA) can pose a security threat due to the intermediate CA being [...]</p>

          <p>To meet user demand, dynamic HTTP-based applications require constant scaling of Kubernetes pods. For applications exposed through Kubernetes ingress objects, the AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes incoming traffic automatically across the newly scaled replicas. When Kubernetes applications scale down due to a decline in demand, certain situations will result in brief interruptions for end [...]</p>

          <p>To build a data-driven business, it is important to democratize enterprise data assets in a data catalog. With a unified data catalog, you can quickly search datasets and figure out data schema, data format, and location.

          <p>When performing disaster recovery, you recover your original systems and IT infrastructure to their original state at an alternate, available site. When you recover your servers, the recovered servers should match the original compute infrastructure to reduce the risk of underprovisioning or overprovisioning your recovery environment. This improves the likelihood that your recovery servers have [...]</p>
