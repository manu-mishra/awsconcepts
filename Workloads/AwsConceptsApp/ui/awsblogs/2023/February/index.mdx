          <p>Tenant data isolation is a core SaaS concept, verifying that tenant resources remain in isolated environments. There are a number of ways to achieve this isolation, and one common approach is to use a token vending machine that issues tenant-scoped credentials at runtime. Explore an alternate approach to vending tokens that uses Amazon EKS and open-source HashiCorp Vault, simplifying access to the credentials and streamlining the overall management of tenant-scoped policies.</p>

          <p>Beginning on April 1, 2023, state Medicaid agencies (SMA) will have one year to unwind temporary COVID-era changes and return to pre-pandemic ways of working. A major part of that will be re-verifying that all 91 million members still qualify to receive Medicaid benefits. For nearly a year, AWS has supported SMAs with in-house Medicaid expertise to identify unwinding issues and develop solutions to address them. The top four concerns that SMAs have shared are in approaching outreach and engagement, staffing shortages, returned mail, and reporting capabilities. Learn how AWS can help states across the country overcome these challenges across different scenarios.</p>

          <p>Fraud detection is an important problem that has applications in financial services, social media, ecommerce, gaming, and other industries. This post presents an implementation of a fraud detection solution using the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) model to predict the probability that a transaction is fraudulent through both the transductive and inductive inference modes. You can deploy our implementation to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint as a real-time fraud detection solution, without requiring external graph storage or orchestration, thereby significantly reducing the deployment cost of the model.</p>

          <p>Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the number one cause of death for student athletes and the leading cause of death on school campuses. The nonprofit Who We Play For (WWPF) advocates for SCA prevention through advocacy, automated external defibrillator (AED) placement, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training, and heart screenings, which include low-cost electrocardiogram (ECG) screenings from physicians that are experts in pediatric ECG interpretation. To scale their efforts, WWPF collaborated with AWS to build a ML solution to help extend the chance to get screened for SCA to every young person, potentially saving many lives each year.</p>

          <p>A new geopolitical and energy market reality has accelerated momentum for the green transition. But there is one geography for which energy is a perennial challenge: islands. Islands have always sought to create a sustainable environment for their populations and have had to use ingenuity, collaboration, and civic will to make it happenand often by using innovative technology. In this way, islands can be viewed as living laboratories of what could be scaled up for mainland communities. As the world responds to the energy crisis, islands can show a path for overcoming energy challenges.</p>

          <p>Many organizations may not fully recognize or calculate the true costs of workload resiliency decisions. These true costs include the full spectrum of costing considerations that make up a decision, from readily-determinable accounting costs to less-recognizable intangible costs. As public sector organizations often have limited resources and complex missions, its important to understand the true costs and economic impact involved in a resiliency decision; this can help these organizations to both prepare and plan with their available resources.</p>

          <p>CDK offers a high-level abstraction to define AWS resources using modern programming languages. Among its components, it provides aws-s3-assets, which is a high level construct that abstracts packaging AWS Lambda functions. The default behavior of this construct is to zip all the content into a folder and upload it to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. That works great for Lambda runtimes like Python or Node.js, which do not require code compilation, but for .NET, Java, or Go, which requires code compilation, youll need extra steps to restore external dependencies, compile the code, and publish the binary. This post will explore how to streamline building, packaging, and publishing .NET Lambda functions using AWS CDK.</p>

          <p>As BJSS demonstrates in this post, hosting a trading platform for a major market in the cloud has long been technically feasible, and the last four years have only solidified the argument for migration of trading systems to cloud infrastructure. The study BJSS performed should be used as confirmation of cloud capabilities by those weighing the cost and opportunity of a transition. Early adopters of cloud services have benefited from the advantages of improved resiliency, scalability, security, and flexibility.</p>

This creates an immense opportunity for AWS Partners to support public sector customers missions while building successful, profitable businesses. How can AWS Partners achieve this multiplier, while helping public sector customers achieve their mission-critical transformation? In my experience working with partners, six key areas of opportunity have emerged that AWS Partners can focus on.</p>

          <p>Scaling a startup successfully involves increasing profit margins exponentially while keeping costs low. Most startups combine a variety of approaches to scale, based on their growth stage and needs. Techniques to scale include finding processes that work and applying them across the board, focusing on customers and building a product that is in high demand, and harnessing AWS cloud technology to move fast and optimize your costs.
SEON, a Hungarian fraud prevention startup founded by Tams Kdr and Bence Jendruszk in 2017, is a model of successful startup scaling.</p>

          <p>In this post, I share a solution that provides an HTTPS-based drive mapping solution via Amazon S3 with Active Directory integration and folder permissions. You can use this solution to enable remote and mobile access to the same Amazon S3 bucket that is backing a local S3 File Gateway instance. The integration enables office-based employees to access files and folders through the local S3 File Gateway. Remote users can access files and folders as if it were still the same S3 File Gateway, with additional benefits for web and mobile features.</p>

          <p>Startups are familiar with the importance of creating great customer experiences. Sentiment analysis is one tool that helps with this. It categorizes data as positive, negative, or neutral based on machine learning techniques such as text analysis and natural language processing (NLP). Companies use sentiment analysis to measure the satisfaction of clients for a target product or service. In this blog post, we explain how Widebot uses Amazon Sagemaker to successfully implement a sentiment classifier for Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian dialect Arabic.</p>
