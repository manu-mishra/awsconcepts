          <p>In this post, I share a solution that provides an HTTPS-based drive mapping solution via Amazon S3 with Active Directory integration and folder permissions. You can use this solution to enable remote and mobile access to the same Amazon S3 bucket that is backing a local S3 File Gateway instance. The integration enables office-based employees to access files and folders through the local S3 File Gateway. Remote users can access files and folders as if it were still the same S3 File Gateway, with additional benefits for web and mobile features.</p>

          <p>Startups are familiar with the importance of creating great customer experiences. Sentiment analysis is one tool that helps with this. It categorizes data as positive, negative, or neutral based on machine learning techniques such as text analysis and natural language processing (NLP). Companies use sentiment analysis to measure the satisfaction of clients for a target product or service. In this blog post, we explain how Widebot uses Amazon Sagemaker to successfully implement a sentiment classifier for Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian dialect Arabic.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in deep learning have led to increasingly large models such as GPT-3, BLOOM, and OPT, some of which are already in excess of 100 billion parameters. Although larger models tend to be more powerful, training such models requires significant computational resources. Even with the use of advanced distributed training libraries like FSDP and [...]</p>

          <p>Organizations have been adopting IPv6 in their IPv4 environments to solve IP address exhaustion or meet compliance requirements. Since IPv6 isn&#8217;t backward compatible with IPv4, several mechanisms can facilitate communication between hosts that support one or both protocols. One common way is by using dual stack deployments. For architectures where dual stack deployments aren&#8217;t the [...]</p>
