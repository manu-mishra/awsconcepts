          <p>Migrating a companys database architecture from an on-premises database to the cloud can be a complicated and time-consuming process. One of the critical decisions is the choice of tooling to deliver the migration, and how to get the best out of the selected tool. This post discusses key learnings and experiences Fujitsu has gained through its use of AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) during database migration projects, primarily from Oracle-to-PostgreSQL migrations.</p>

          <p>CDK offers a high-level abstraction to define AWS resources using modern programming languages. Among its components, it provides aws-s3-assets, which is a high level construct that abstracts packaging AWS Lambda functions. The default behavior of this construct is to zip all the content into a folder and upload it to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. That works great for Lambda runtimes like Python or Node.js, which do not require code compilation, but for .NET, Java, or Go, which requires code compilation, youll need extra steps to restore external dependencies, compile the code, and publish the binary. This post will explore how to streamline building, packaging, and publishing .NET Lambda functions using AWS CDK.</p>
