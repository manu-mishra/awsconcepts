          <p>As BJSS demonstrates in this post, hosting a trading platform for a major market in the cloud has long been technically feasible, and the last four years have only solidified the argument for migration of trading systems to cloud infrastructure. The study BJSS performed should be used as confirmation of cloud capabilities by those weighing the cost and opportunity of a transition. Early adopters of cloud services have benefited from the advantages of improved resiliency, scalability, security, and flexibility.</p>

Often, each data source will have its own processes of creating and maintaining data, which can lead to data quality challenges within and across sources.
