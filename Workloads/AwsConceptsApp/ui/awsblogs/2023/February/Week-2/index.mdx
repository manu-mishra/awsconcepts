Often, each data source will have its own processes of creating and maintaining data, which can lead to data quality challenges within and across sources. One challenge you may face when performing analytics is the presence of imperfect duplicate records within the source data. This post presents one possible approach to addressing this challenge in an Amazon Redshift data warehouse using fuzzy matching.</p>

          <p>As Ive built the UK&amp;I public sector partner team, we have observed less and less customers wanting to solely use their internal resources for their digital transformation. They need guidance, support, services, and solutions from their partners. This creates an immense opportunity for AWS Partners to support public sector customers missions while building successful, profitable businesses. How can AWS Partners achieve this multiplier, while helping public sector customers achieve their mission-critical transformation? In my experience working with partners, six key areas of opportunity have emerged that AWS Partners can focus on.</p>
