          <p>Tenant data isolation is a core SaaS concept, verifying that tenant resources remain in isolated environments. There are a number of ways to achieve this isolation, and one common approach is to use a token vending machine that issues tenant-scoped credentials at runtime. Explore an alternate approach to vending tokens that uses Amazon EKS and open-source HashiCorp Vault, simplifying access to the credentials and streamlining the overall management of tenant-scoped policies.</p>

          <p>Beginning on April 1, 2023, state Medicaid agencies (SMA) will have one year to unwind temporary COVID-era changes and return to pre-pandemic ways of working. A major part of that will be re-verifying that all 91 million members still qualify to receive Medicaid benefits. For nearly a year, AWS has supported SMAs with in-house Medicaid expertise to identify unwinding issues and develop solutions to address them. The top four concerns that SMAs have shared are in approaching outreach and engagement, staffing shortages, returned mail, and reporting capabilities. Learn how AWS can help states across the country overcome these challenges across different scenarios.</p>

          <p>Fraud detection is an important problem that has applications in financial services, social media, ecommerce, gaming, and other industries. This post presents an implementation of a fraud detection solution using the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) model to predict the probability that a transaction is fraudulent through both the transductive and inductive inference modes. You can deploy our implementation to an Amazon SageMaker endpoint as a real-time fraud detection solution, without requiring external graph storage or orchestration, thereby significantly reducing the deployment cost of the model.</p>
