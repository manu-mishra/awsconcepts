          <p>I often get asked how I transitioned from a software development role to a cloud role. If you had asked me a year ago if I would want a career in cloud, I would have told you ‘Not a chance’. I didn’t even know how exactly the cloud worked. In this blog, I’ll share why that changed and how I went from no cloud experience to achieving three AWS Certifications in less than a year. I knew Amazon Web Services (AWS) offered industry-recognized certifications, but I wasn’t really sure how to get started and where to go to prepare for these certifications. This blog will also cover the resources I utilized to prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, AWS Certified Solutions Architect &#8211; Associate and AWS Certified Solutions Architect &#8211; Professional exams.</p>

          <p>Containerized applications often have several distinct environments and accounts, such as dev, test, and prod. An application has to go through a process of deployment and testing in these environments. One common pattern for deploying containerized applications is to have a central AWS create a single container image, and carry out deployment across other AWS accounts. To achieve automated deployment of the application across different environments, customers use CI/CD pipelines with familiar container tooling. This blog post explores how to use AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) Pipelines to create a CI/CD deployment pipeline and deploy a container-based Lambda function across multiple accounts.</p>
