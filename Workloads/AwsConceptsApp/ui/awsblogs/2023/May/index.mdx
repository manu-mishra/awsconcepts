          <p>This post will show how you can optimize your x86 Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute workloads with no architectural changes. We will focus on improving price-to-performance without introducing engineering overhead, large planning cycles and significant time investment. The optimizations mentioned today require no application engineering and can be done quickly. The focal point of this post is showing the benefits of running your x86 EC2 workloads on AMD based EC2 instances to achieve at least 10% cost savings.</p>

          <p>Customers may prefer to host their Oracle database workloads in a managed service such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Oracle because of the benefits offered by managed services. However, there could be workloads that have dependencies on Oracle features that arent supported by Amazon RDS for Oracle. For example, the flashback database [...]</p>

          <p>Running machine learning (ML) workloads with containers is becoming a common practice. Containers can fully encapsulate not just your training code, but the entire dependency stack down to the hardware libraries and drivers. What you get is an ML development environment that is consistent and portable. With containers, scaling on a cluster becomes much easier. [...]</p>

          <p>Oxford Nanopore sequencers enables direct, real-time analysis of long DNA or RNA fragments. They work by monitoring changes to an electrical current as nucleic acids are passed through a protein nanopore. The resulting signal is decoded to provide the specific DNA or RNA sequence by virtue of compute-intensive algorithms called basecallers. This blog post presents the benchmarking results for two of those Oxford Nanopore basecallers Guppy and Dorado on AWS. This benchmarking project was conducted in collaboration between G42 Healthcare, Oxford Nanopore Technologies and AWS.</p>

          <p>Topology Aware Hints (TAH) is a feature that available in Amazon EKS version 1.24. Its intended to provide a mechanism that attempts to keep traffic closer to its origin within the same AZ on in another location. In this post, well explore how this feature can be used with Amazon EKS, its effects on how traffic is routed between pods within an Amazon EKS cluster when using multiple AZs, and whether this functionality allows Amazon EKS customers to optimize the latency and inter-AZ data transfer costs in this architecture.</p>

          <p>When choosing the infrastructure for their ML workloads, startups should consider how to best approach training and inference. Training is process by which a model is built and tuned for a specific task by learning from existing data. Inference is the process of using that model to make predictions based on new input data. Over the last five years, AWS has been investing in our own purpose-built accelerators to push the envelope on performance and compute cost for ML workloads.AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia accelerators enable the lowest cost for training models and running inference in the cloud.</p>

          <p>I often get asked how I transitioned from a software development role to a cloud role. If you had asked me a year ago if I would want a career in cloud, I would have told you Not a chance. I didnt even know how exactly the cloud worked. In this blog, Ill share why that changed and how I went from no cloud experience to achieving three AWS Certifications in less than a year. I knew Amazon Web Services (AWS) offered industry-recognized certifications, but I wasnt really sure how to get started and where to go to prepare for these certifications. This blog will also cover the resources I utilized to prepare for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional exams.</p>

          <p>Containerized applications often have several distinct environments and accounts, such as dev, test, and prod. An application has to go through a process of deployment and testing in these environments. One common pattern for deploying containerized applications is to have a central AWS create a single container image, and carry out deployment across other AWS accounts. To achieve automated deployment of the application across different environments, customers use CI/CD pipelines with familiar container tooling. This blog post explores how to use AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) Pipelines to create a CI/CD deployment pipeline and deploy a container-based Lambda function across multiple accounts.</p>

          <p>Geospatial data, including many climate and weather datasets, are often released by government and nonprofit organizations in compressed file formats such as the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) or GRIdded Binary (GRIB). As the complexity and size of geospatial datasets continue to grow, it is more time- and cost-efficient to leave the files in one place, virtually query the data, and download only the subset that is needed locally. Unlike legacy file formats, the cloud-native Zarr format is designed for virtual and efficient access to compressed chunks of data saved in a central location such as Amazon S3. In this walkthrough, learn how to convert NetCDF datasets to Zarr using an Amazon SageMaker notebook and an AWS Fargate cluster and query the resulting Zarr store, reducing the time required for time series queries from minutes to seconds.</p>
