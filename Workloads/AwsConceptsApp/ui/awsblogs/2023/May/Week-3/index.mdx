          <p>Oxford Nanopore sequencers enables direct, real-time analysis of long DNA or RNA fragments. They work by monitoring changes to an electrical current as nucleic acids are passed through a protein nanopore. The resulting signal is decoded to provide the specific DNA or RNA sequence by virtue of  compute-intensive algorithms called basecallers. This blog post presents the benchmarking results for two of those Oxford Nanopore basecallers — Guppy and Dorado — on AWS. This benchmarking project was conducted in collaboration between G42 Healthcare, Oxford Nanopore Technologies and AWS.</p>

          <p>Ground-based, extremely large telescopes (ELTs), such as the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), will play a crucial role in modern astronomy by providing observations of the universe with remarkable clarity and detail. However, managing the vast amount of data generated by these instruments and supporting optimal performance can be a challenging task. AWS provides a suite of cloud-based solutions that can help address these challenges and streamline ELT operations. Learn how various AWS services can be used to optimize data storage, management, and processing, as well as advanced monitoring and remote continuity techniques, leading to improved overall performance and efficiency for ELTs.</p>

          <p>Topology Aware Hints (TAH) is a feature that available in Amazon EKS version 1.24. It’s intended to provide a mechanism that attempts to keep traffic closer to its origin within the same AZ on in another location. In this post, we’ll explore how this feature can be used with Amazon EKS, its effects on how traffic is routed between pods within an Amazon EKS cluster when using multiple AZs, and whether this functionality allows Amazon EKS customers to optimize the latency and inter-AZ data transfer costs in this architecture.</p>

          <p>When choosing the infrastructure for their ML workloads, startups should consider how to best approach training and inference. Training is process by which a model is built and tuned for a specific task by learning from existing data. Inference is the process of using that model to make predictions based on new input data. Over the last five years, AWS has been investing in our own purpose-built accelerators to push the envelope on performance and compute cost for ML workloads. AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia accelerators enable the lowest cost for training models and running inference in the cloud.</p>
