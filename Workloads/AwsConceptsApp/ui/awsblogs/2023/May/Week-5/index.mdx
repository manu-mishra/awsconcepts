          <p>This post will show how you can optimize your x86 Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute workloads with no architectural changes. We will focus on improving price-to-performance without introducing engineering overhead, large planning cycles and significant time investment. The optimizations mentioned today require no application engineering and can be done quickly. The focal point of this post is showing the benefits of running your x86 EC2 workloads on AMD based EC2 instances to achieve at least 10% cost savings.</p>
