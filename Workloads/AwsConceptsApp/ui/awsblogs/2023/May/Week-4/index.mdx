          <p>A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that is dynamically updated with data to mimic the structure, state, and behavior of the physical system. Explore the results of MHP’s efforts working with AWS to build and deploy a Level 4 digital twin for an electric vehicle, as a means for monitoring and analyzing batteries of EVs utilizing live data, fleet knowledge, and AI. We’ll share a use case of battery health and performance management by learning driver behavior and battery characteristics from the fleet.</p>
