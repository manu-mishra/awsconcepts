          <p>If you have applications spread across multiple Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and want to expose those applications to the Internet, you can choose from different approaches. One option is to give each VPC its own dedicated connectivity to the Internet through an attached Internet gateway. Another approach is to centralize access from the Internet through [...]</p>

          <p>Many people are under the impression that cloud computing, which is marked by pay-as-you-go pricing, is impossible to buy with year-end funds. However, AWS has solutions to help you obligate year-end funds to secure a cloud future. The end of the federal government fiscal year is fast approaching. With budget left to spend before September 30, the clock is ticking for agencies to obligate their remaining FY2018 funds.</p>

          <p>Users today dont expect to be tied to a desktop computer. They want to interact with systems on the go, in a variety of ways that are convenient to them. This means that people often turn to mobile devices and interact with applications and systems while multi-tasking. Users might not even touch their mobile device while operating the apps they use, particularly when they are in a vehicle, or when they are actively engaged in another activity. In home environments, this hands-free capability is facilitated by voice activation systems.
Business users now aspire to the same experience in a business environment. They want to operate the applications and systems that they use in their daily work tasks using voice control, just like they do at home. Imagine how much simpler daily work tasks would be. However, adding voice controls to systems has not been easy.Voice integration can be a very involved project, even for skilled developers. Moreover, todays business users want to solve their own tactical and strategic business problems by building low code/no code apps. Plus, business users want these apps to follow the same end-user requirements we mentioned earlier: They need to be able to be used on the go anywhere, anytime, hands-free.</p>

          <p>Since going live in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope has delivered groundbreaking images to broaden our understanding of the universe. Each image captured by the telescope is archived and made publicly available, free of cost, by NASA through the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). The Hubble images archive is used by a global community of astronomers, researchers, and engineers and has led to the discovery of distant galaxies and nebulae. The legacy is a treasure trove of data that can be mined in the future, Arfon Smith, head of data science at STScI, said.</p>

          <p>Mainframe monoliths have grown over the years with overwhelming complexity. They often mix different languages and data stores with various interfaces, evolving coding standards, online and batch, and millions of lines of code. With AWS, customers use microservices for agility, elasticity, and pay-as-you-go cloud technology. In this post, we explore AWS Blu Age solutions to peel off AWS microservices from a mainframe monolith, and how to solve data challenges associated with such a migration.</p>

          <p>You can easily get started extracting meaningful metadata from your media files by using the Media Analysis Solution on AWS. The Media Analysis Solution provides AWS CloudFormation templates that you can use to start extracting meaningful metadata from your media files within minutes. With a web-based user interface, you can easily upload files and see the metadata that is automatically extracted. This solution uses Amazon Rekognition for facial recognition, Amazon Transcribe to create a transcript, and Amazon Comprehend to run sentiment analysis on the transcript. You can also upload your own images to an Amazon Rekognition collection and train the solution to recognize individuals. In this blog post, well show you step-by step how to launch the solution and upload an image and video. Youll be able to see firsthand how metadata is seamlessly extracted.</p>
