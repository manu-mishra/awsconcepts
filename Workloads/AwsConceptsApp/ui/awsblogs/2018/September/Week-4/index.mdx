          <p>The U.S. Air Force migrated the Air Force Portal, which posts officer promotional lists and other information, to the cloud. With a pay-as-you-go model, the Air Force only has to pay if the portal is being used, instead of a flat fee upfront. This model leads to savings when traffic is down. Migrating applications to a commercial cloud eliminates the need for the government to manage and sustain enough servers in times of maximum traffic such as staff sergeant promotion release days.</p>

          <p>By leveraging services like Amazon S3 to host content, AWS Competency Partner Cloudar has a cost effective way to build websites that are highly available. If content is stored in a single Amazon S3 bucket, all of the content is stored in a single AWS region. To serve content from other regions, you need to route requests to different Amazon S3 buckets. In this post, explore how to accomplished this by using Amazon CloudFront as a content delivery network and Lambda@Edge as a router.</p>
