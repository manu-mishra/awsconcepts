          <p>The anti-social downsides of social technologies are starting to be a big concern for tech companies these days.

          <p>As SaaS organizations grow and begin to extend their global reach, they must consider how their larger geographic footprint will shape and influence the architecture of their systems. Operations, deployment, agility, security, and scale all can be impacted by the move to a geographically distributed SaaS model. The more complexity that is added to a system&#8217;s operational and deployment profile, the more challenging it becomes to maintain the agility goals that are often associated SaaS delivery models.</p>
