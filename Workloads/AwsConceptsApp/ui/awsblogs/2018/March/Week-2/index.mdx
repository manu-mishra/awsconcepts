          <p>Government organizations use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to address their unique challenges, requirements, and missions. We listen to our customers then innovate and deliver technology that helps them solve problems faster, adapt to changing environments, deal with sudden demand, and adhere to the highest security standards. With AWS, government organizations can rapidly prototype, trying several architectures in parallel, allowing them to more quickly evaluate their options and move to full deployment for new programs and systems.</p>

          <p>A customer has been successfully creating and running multiple Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) domains to support their business users search needs across products, orders, support documentation, and a growing suite of similar needs. The service has become heavily used across the organization. This led to some domains running at 100% capacity during peak times, while others began to run low on storage space. Because of this increased usage, the technical teams were in danger of missing their service level agreements. They contacted me for help.
This post shows how you can set up automated alarms to warn when domains need attention.</p>
