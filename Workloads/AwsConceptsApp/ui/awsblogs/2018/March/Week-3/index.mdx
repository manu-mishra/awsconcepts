The City on a Cloud Innovation Challenge is a global program recognizing how local and regional governments are innovating on behalf of their citizens around the globe. Last year, we opened up the competition to school districts who are using the cloud to enrich learning, help teachers reach more students, and improve school or district operations. This year, we are adding a new category to the Challenge: We Power Tech.</p>

          <p>See how you can now use Amazon CloudFront to negotiate HTTPS connections to origins using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA uses smaller keys that are faster, yet, just as secure, as the older RSA algorithm. The smaller keys will also increase the number of TLS handshakes that your origins can process per second, thereby saving compute cycles and reducing your cost of cryptography.</p>

Expanding into many more accounts was necessary in order to best align with our GDPR and security initiatives. In order to continue scaling gracefully, we are centrally managing employee access to AWS with terraform and our identity provider. To organize the expansion into numerous accounts, we needed a mechanism to control our accounts, which accounts employees have access to, and each employees permissions in each account.</p>
