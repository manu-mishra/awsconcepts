          <p>At the University of Oklahoma, we asked ourselves: Can Amazon Alexa help engage college students and enhance their educational experience? How will students utilize voice technology as they graduate and move into their careers? Within the University of Oklahoma IT department, we aim to affect the student experience on campus in more ways than just delivering technology. We have found that the more a student is engaged on campus, the more likely they are to graduate. Technology innovation, like Alexa, will play a major role in that mission.</p>

Organizations can simplify their hybrid IT operations by using the same VMware technologies&#8212;including vSphere, vSAN, NSX, and vCenter&#8212;across their on-premises datacenters and on the AWS cloud. In this post, and my follow-up, we explore the major components of Amazon VPC for engineers and architects who build and operate VMware NSX networks, and who are building solutions on VMware Cloud on AWS.</p>

          <p>Networking is often viewed as a foundational element of a system&#8217;s architecture. The reality is there are plenty of scenarios where the networking footprint of a SaaS application can influence the functionality, extensibility, and management profile of your SaaS environment. While there are plenty of creative ways developers leverage AWS networking constructs to refine SaaS solutions, the introduction of AWS PrivateLink adds new opportunities in the SaaS networking landscape.</p>

          <p>National defense organizations have some of the most demanding software requirements in the world. Stringent security standards and complex environments make it challenging for developers to work efficiently. Because systems are deployed across large, proprietary government data centers, development teams find it challenging to create production-like environments for coding and testing. This, in turn, reduces the number of testing cycles that can be performed in a given amount of time.</p>

With that in mind, migrating Mainframe applications to the cloud seems more like a necessity than a luxury.</p>
