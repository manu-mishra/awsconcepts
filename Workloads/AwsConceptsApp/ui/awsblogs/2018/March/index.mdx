          <p>Government organizations use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to address their unique challenges, requirements, and missions. We listen to our customers then innovate and deliver technology that helps them solve problems faster, adapt to changing environments, deal with sudden demand, and adhere to the highest security standards. With AWS, government organizations can rapidly prototype, trying several architectures in parallel, allowing them to more quickly evaluate their options and move to full deployment for new programs and systems.</p>

          <p>A customer has been successfully creating and running multiple Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) domains to support their business users search needs across products, orders, support documentation, and a growing suite of similar needs. The service has become heavily used across the organization. This led to some domains running at 100% capacity during peak times, while others began to run low on storage space. Because of this increased usage, the technical teams were in danger of missing their service level agreements. They contacted me for help.
This post shows how you can set up automated alarms to warn when domains need attention.</p>

A 2017 report by the National Center for Women and Information Technology reveals that women hold only 20% of computing jobs in the U.S. and that this number is declining, not increasing. In 2015, only 18% of Computer and Information Sciences bachelors degree recipients were women. In addition to We Power Tech, AWS is working with several nonprofit organizations who are leading the way by empowering, training, and creating a community for women engineers, developers, designers, entrepreneurs, leaders, and more, around the world</p>

The City on a Cloud Innovation Challenge is a global program recognizing how local and regional governments are innovating on behalf of their citizens around the globe. Last year, we opened up the competition to school districts who are using the cloud to enrich learning, help teachers reach more students, and improve school or district operations. This year, we are adding a new category to the Challenge: We Power Tech.</p>

          <p>See how you can now use Amazon CloudFront to negotiate HTTPS connections to origins using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). ECDSA uses smaller keys that are faster, yet, just as secure, as the older RSA algorithm. The smaller keys will also increase the number of TLS handshakes that your origins can process per second, thereby saving compute cycles and reducing your cost of cryptography.</p>

Expanding into many more accounts was necessary in order to best align with our GDPR and security initiatives. In order to continue scaling gracefully, we are centrally managing employee access to AWS with terraform and our identity provider. To organize the expansion into numerous accounts, we needed a mechanism to control our accounts, which accounts employees have access to, and each employees permissions in each account.</p>

How will students utilize voice technology as they graduate and move into their careers? Within the University of Oklahoma IT department, we aim to affect the student experience on campus in more ways than just delivering technology. We have found that the more a student is engaged on campus, the more likely they are to graduate. Technology innovation, like Alexa, will play a major role in that mission.</p>

          <p>National defense organizations have some of the most demanding software requirements in the world. Stringent security standards and complex environments make it challenging for developers to work efficiently. Because systems are deployed across large, proprietary government data centers, development teams find it challenging to create production-like environments for coding and testing. This, in turn, reduces the number of testing cycles that can be performed in a given amount of time.</p>

With that in mind, migrating Mainframe applications to the cloud seems more like a necessity than a luxury.</p>

Operations, deployment, agility, security, and scale all can be impacted by the move to a geographically distributed SaaS model. The more complexity that is added to a systems operational and deployment profile, the more challenging it becomes to maintain the agility goals that are often associated SaaS delivery models.</p>
