          <p>As our online lives expand and businesses find new and better ways to provide everyday services via the internet, it can feel like increasing amounts of our sensitive data are in the hands of companies without stellar track records of keeping that data safe. James Neville, CEO and founder of Citizen, a one-touch login and registration app, hopes to change that metric. We were working in payments, and it struck us how loose the security was around personal data when compared to card or bank accounts, he explains. And its only gotten worse over the years. Hes right.</p>

          <p>No matter where you work, accounting for your costs can be complex. This is especially true in the public sector, where organizations, universities, and other entities are required to adhere to strict accounting constraints particularly when accounting for grants and other forms of external funding. Oftentimes, customers use external funding to purchase cloud resources, so it is important that these funds are only allocated towards costs associated with the specific researcher or project for which the external funding was obtained.</p>

AWS customers are encouraged to leave reviews on APN Partner engagements that have been launched for more than two (2) weeks. This gives your organization some time to adjust to the new solution or workload delivered by the APN Partner, resulting in a more detailed, thorough review.</p>

          <p>Hyperledger Sawtooth is an enterprise blockchain platform for building distributed ledger applications and networks. Built by Intel, Sawtooth simplifies blockchain application development by separating the core system from the application domain. Application developers can specify the business rules appropriate for their application, using the language of their choice, without needing to know the underlying design of the core system. Sawtooth validators can be run from pre-built Docker containers and launched on AWS.</p>

          <p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. But in itself, Kubernetes is not enough to achieve this goal. To fully empower our engineers, we need to build a CI/CD pipeline around Kubernetes. Using this tutorial from APN Partner Slalom Consulting, we have built a Kubernetes cluster with a good set of security defaults and then wrapped a simple CI/CD pipeline around it.</p>
