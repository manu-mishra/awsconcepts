          <p>As our online lives expand and businesses find new and better ways to provide everyday services via the internet, it can feel like increasing amounts of our sensitive data are in the hands of companies without stellar track records of keeping that data safe. James Neville, CEO and founder of Citizen, a one-touch login and registration app, hopes to change that metric. &#8220;We were working in payments, and it struck us how loose the security was around personal data when compared to card or bank accounts,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;And it&#8217;s only gotten worse over the years.&#8221; He&#8217;s right.</p>

          <p>No matter where you work, accounting for your costs can be complex. This is especially true in the public sector, where organizations, universities, and other entities are required to adhere to strict accounting constraints - particularly when accounting for grants and other forms of external funding. Oftentimes, customers use external funding to purchase cloud resources, so it is important that these funds are only allocated towards costs associated with the specific researcher or project for which the external funding was obtained.</p>

This gives your organization some time to adjust to the new solution or workload delivered by the APN Partner, resulting in a more detailed, thorough review.</p>

          <p>Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed and highly scalable machine learning (ML) platform that makes it easy build, train, and deploy machine learning models. This is a giant step towards the democratization of ML and in lowering the bar for entry in to the ML space for developers. Computer vision is the branch of machine learning [...]</p>

          <p>Today, we are launching several new features for the&#160;Amazon SageMaker BlazingText algorithm. Many downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation require the text data to be converted into real-valued vectors. Customers have been using BlazingText&#8217;s highly optimized implementation of the Word2Vec algorithm, for learning these vectors from [...]</p>

          <p>Providing for clients is imperative, but what about the problems that arise on the other side of the equation, within a company&#8217;s sales teams? With a sales force trying to not only finalize a deal, but also provide quality after-sale service for years to come, organization becomes crucial for longevity and sustained success. And that&#8217;s where Pipedrive comes in, streamlining and simplifying tasks, duties, and deadlines for sales teams in the office or around the world.</p>

          <p>Coarse location tracking is a subset of location tracking where the approximate location of an asset (within a 20-mile radius) suffices the use-case requirements. Learn how you can use network-based location and AWS IoT to track coarse location of assets using deep integration between AWS IoT, AWS IoT Analytics, and Eseye&#8217;s AnyNet Secure SIM, a one-stop, global cellular connectivity solution. Eseye is an APN Advanced Technology Partner with the AWS IoT Competency.</p>
