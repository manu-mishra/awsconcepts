Adoption of VMware Cloud on AWS is accelerating in the enterprise as customers are able to migrate, run, and protect production workloads at scale to deliver business outcomes.

          <p>H2O is an open source data machine learning platformthat provides a flexible, user-friendly tool to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners.It was created by H2O.ai, an APN Advanced Partner withthe AWS Machine Learning Competency. In this post,we look atsetting up an H2O cluster, import data from Amazon S3, create an AWS Lambda deployment package from the model, and finally deploy a RESTful endpoint. Following these steps, you can migrate your H2O Flows to AWS in about 10 minutes.</p>

          <p>At the most basic level, a term sheet is a non-binding contract. Its a short document, anywhere from 1-10 pages, that has a handful of terms outlining what will happen in an investment. If a deal goes through, lawyers will take the term sheet and turn it into hundreds of pages of legal documentation.</p>
