          <p>Imagine you are on a city street surrounded by skyscrapers. When you look up to the stars, you will only see the part of the sky that is not blocked by buildings. This type of vision is called sky view factor (SVF). The SVF denotes the ratio between the radiation received at a point on Earth and the available radiation for a hemisphere over that point. Dr. Andrea Pagani, a data scientist at the DataLab of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, has been looking at how to efficiently compute the SVF for the Netherlands. Read on to learn more about Dr. Paganis work to help us understand whats between us and the sky and why that matters.</p>

Intelligence is advancing to the point where there is no separation between task and technology, and the result is that medical trainees and educators can be relieved of mundane administrative duties. Our partners in medical education work with us so that one day this ideal future becomes a reality.
The future is not far away, and thanks to AWS and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, our company has been able to build an infrastructure that scales to meet our customers demands. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) made our transition to Aurora PostgreSQL a seamless experience for both our customers and our software developers, while minimizing the risk. We used AWS DMS to fully migrate 700+ instances of Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora PostgreSQL. In addition, Amazon RDS Performance Insights now gives us excellent visibility into our database layer and allows us to respond quickly to any abnormalities.</p>

          <p>You may have heard of Amazon Aurora, a custom built MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible database born and built in the cloud. You may have also heard of serverless, which allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about instances. These are two pieces of the growing AWS technology story that were really excited to be working on. Last year, at AWS re:Invent we announced a preview of a new capability for Aurora called Aurora Serverless. Today, Im pleased to announce that Aurora Serverless for Aurora MySQL is generally available. Aurora Serverless is on-demand, auto-scaling, serverless Aurora. You dont have to think about instances or scaling and you pay only for what you use.</p>
