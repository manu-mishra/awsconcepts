          <p>We have a new resource to help our financial services customers in Brazil navigate regulatory requirements for using the cloud. The AWS User Guide to Financial Services Regulations in Brazil is a deep dive into the Brazilian National Monetary Council&#8217;s Resolution No. 4,658. The cybersecurity cloud resolution is the first of its kind by regulators [...]</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Department of Defense migrates more mission-critical workloads to the cloud, the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) recently upgraded its training-delivery application, moving it from its on-premises data center into a commercial cloud environment. With this upgrade, DLA employees have improved capability, and the agency is blazing a trail within the DoD for the use of commercial cloud to empower the workforce.</p>

          <p>In this post, I will show you how to develop an original RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) deep learning algorithm to forecast time series based on the past trends of multiple factors, taking advantage of Amazon SageMaker (using Bring-Your-Own-Algorithm). Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed machine learning platform that enables data scientists and developers to quickly and easily build and train machine learning models into production applications, at scale. It enables you to use both built-in algorithms, built-in frameworks, and also import custom code via Docker containers.</p>

          <p>We launched a new feature for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) called Enhanced Fan-out, which enables developers to take advantage of a new low latency HTTP/2 data retrieval API. This new API allows customers to attach more applications to a single data stream while maintaining read performance across all of the applications consuming the stream. The HTTP/2 interface reduces the latency between ingestion of data and consumption of data by a consumer application by about 75%, down to less than 50 milliseconds.</p>

When people ask me what impact artificial intelligence (AI) will have in the enterprise, I like to say that AI will relieve people from doing repetitive things. We&#8217;re not wired to do mindless tasks over and over&#8212;but computers are. That&#8217;s why self-driving [...]</p>

          <p>In this post, we discuss how Pagely worked with Beyondsoft, an AWS Advanced Consulting Partner, to use ConvergDB, an open-source tool developed by Beyondsoft, to build a DevOps-centric data pipeline. This pipeline uses AWS Glue to transform application logs into optimized tables that can be queried quickly and cost effectively using Amazon Athena.</p>

          <p>Public sector organizations worldwide have responsibility for high-value assets and operations associated with utilities, public venues, roads, bridges, transit and mobility systems, airports, ports, and public health systems. Unexpected downtime can lead to critical outages that cost millions of dollars in lost productivity, but replacing or fixing broken equipment can also cost tens of thousands of dollars in extra expenses. Predictive maintenance analytics capture the state of the equipment, so you can identify potential breakdowns before they impact operations.</p>
