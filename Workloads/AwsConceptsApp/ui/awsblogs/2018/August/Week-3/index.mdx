          <p>Memsource is always looking out for exciting new integrations that enhance its cutting-edge translation solutions. With machine translation (MT) continuing to be a hot topic in the localization industry, Memsource is focusing on integrating with innovative MT engines that meet customers&#8217; growing MT needs.
In particular, Memsource strives to offer neural machine translation (NMT) engines, such as Amazon Translate. NMT is proving to be a highly influential technology. The quality of NMT output continues to improve, making it a powerful productivity tool and therefore more in demand. Amazon Translate, with its deep learning methods, has started to make its mark in the translation and localization industry. It&#8217;s become a priority to add it to Memsource&#8217;s range of MT engines. It is also a natural fit for existing AWS customers.
Another draw is that the engine aligns with Memsource&#8217;s enterprise focus, particularly B2C. Amazon Translate is built on Amazon&#8217;s expertise in consumer products and communication, and the localization problems they have solved using machine translation.</p>
