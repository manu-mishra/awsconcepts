          <p>In this blog post, Ill show you how to perform exploratory analysis on massive corporate data sets in Amazon SageMaker. From your Jupyter notebook running on Amazon SageMaker, youll identify and explore several corporate datasets in the corporate data lake that seem interesting to you. Youll discover that each contains a subset of the information you need. Youll join them to extract the interesting information, then continue analyzing and visualizing your data in your Amazon SageMaker notebook, in a seamless experience.</p>

          <p>Having to debug a system with logs scattered in different places can make troubleshooting difficult, which is one of the reasons we recommend customers deliver AWS CloudTrail logs to a centralized Amazon S3 bucket. Although aggregating these logs is a big step forward, it still requires something to parse the logs and alert based on anomalies or high-risk API calls. Customers can integrate with solutions such as Datadog, which allows you to configure monitors and send critical change notifications to your team.</p>

          <p>Achieving sustainable development and addressing local and national needs requires access and analysis of large datasets and the use of complex tools and algorithms. This creates barriers for many users, particularly for communities in developing countries where resources for data storage and data analysis are limited. The African Regional Data Cube (ARDC), a new data management technology developed on AWS, hopes to address this challenge by building capacity in those communities to access large datasets in support of their local and national needs framed around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the broader development priorities.</p>
