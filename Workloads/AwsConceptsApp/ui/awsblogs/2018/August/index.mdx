          <p>There is no one-size-fits-all for mainframe modernization to AWS. Depending on the business and IT strategy, customers select the most suitable pattern for them. If the mainframe is large enough to process multiple workloads, the characteristics can favor different patterns. Fortunately, based on our experience from successful customer modernization projects to AWS, we have identified patterns, lessons learned, and best practices that facilitate new mainframe-to-AWS initiatives.</p>

To combat this, the annual Fishackathon, first organized by the U.S. Secretary of States Office of Global Partnerships in 2014 and organized this year in partnership with HackerNest, took place in over 40 cities around the globe.</p>

          <p>Imagine you are on a city street surrounded by skyscrapers. When you look up to the stars, you will only see the part of the sky that is not blocked by buildings. This type of vision is called sky view factor (SVF). The SVF denotes the ratio between the radiation received at a point on Earth and the available radiation for a hemisphere over that point. Dr. Andrea Pagani, a data scientist at the DataLab of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, has been looking at how to efficiently compute the SVF for the Netherlands. Read on to learn more about Dr. Paganis work to help us understand whats between us and the sky and why that matters.</p>

Intelligence is advancing to the point where there is no separation between task and technology, and the result is that medical trainees and educators can be relieved of mundane administrative duties. Our partners in medical education work with us so that one day this ideal future becomes a reality.
The future is not far away, and thanks to AWS and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, our company has been able to build an infrastructure that scales to meet our customers demands. AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) made our transition to Aurora PostgreSQL a seamless experience for both our customers and our software developers, while minimizing the risk. We used AWS DMS to fully migrate 700+ instances of Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora PostgreSQL. In addition, Amazon RDS Performance Insights now gives us excellent visibility into our database layer and allows us to respond quickly to any abnormalities.</p>

          <p>You may have heard of Amazon Aurora, a custom built MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible database born and built in the cloud. You may have also heard of serverless, which allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about instances. These are two pieces of the growing AWS technology story that were really excited to be working on. Last year, at AWS re:Invent we announced a preview of a new capability for Aurora called Aurora Serverless. Today, Im pleased to announce that Aurora Serverless for Aurora MySQL is generally available. Aurora Serverless is on-demand, auto-scaling, serverless Aurora. You dont have to think about instances or scaling and you pay only for what you use.</p>

          <p>In this post, the first in an APN Blog series about Amazon FreeRTOS development for AWS IoT Core, we go through the setup required for running the Amazon FreeRTOS application, how it works on a high level, and how to connect it to AWS IoT Core. We will also present Percepio Tracealyzer, a tool for debugging the real-time behavior of Amazon FreeRTOS applications, together with a real-world example where Tracealyzer was used to analyze a connectivity issue I encountered when getting started with this project.</p>

          <p>Memsource is always looking out for exciting new integrations that enhance its cutting-edge translation solutions. With machine translation (MT) continuing to be a hot topic in the localization industry, Memsource is focusing on integrating with innovative MT engines that meet customers growing MT needs.
In particular, Memsource strives to offer neural machine translation (NMT) engines, such as Amazon Translate. NMT is proving to be a highly influential technology. The quality of NMT output continues to improve, making it a powerful productivity tool and therefore more in demand. Amazon Translate, with its deep learning methods, has started to make its mark in the translation and localization industry. Its become a priority to add it to Memsources range of MT engines. It is also a natural fit for existing AWS customers.
Another draw is that the engine aligns with Memsources enterprise focus, particularly B2C. Amazon Translate is built on Amazons expertise in consumer products and communication, and the localization problems they have solved using machine translation.</p>

          <p>We launched a new feature for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) called Enhanced Fan-out, which enables developers to take advantage of a new low latency HTTP/2 data retrieval API. This new API allows customers to attach more applications to a single data stream while maintaining read performance across all of the applications consuming the stream. The HTTP/2 interface reduces the latency between ingestion of data and consumption of data by a consumer application by about 75%, down to less than 50 milliseconds.</p>

          <p>Having to debug a system with logs scattered in different places can make troubleshooting difficult, which is one of the reasons we recommend customers deliver AWS CloudTrail logs to a centralized Amazon S3 bucket. Although aggregating these logs is a big step forward, it still requires something to parse the logs and alert based on anomalies or high-risk API calls. Customers can integrate with solutions such as Datadog, which allows you to configure monitors and send critical change notifications to your team.</p>

          <p>Achieving sustainable development and addressing local and national needs requires access and analysis of large datasets and the use of complex tools and algorithms. This creates barriers for many users, particularly for communities in developing countries where resources for data storage and data analysis are limited. The African Regional Data Cube (ARDC), a new data management technology developed on AWS, hopes to address this challenge by building capacity in those communities to access large datasets in support of their local and national needs framed around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the broader development priorities.</p>
