          <p>Fife Public Schools provides a device for every kid in the district. But like many schools with 1:1 programs, they ran into challenges when trying to provide specialty software programs to students. CTE (Careers and Technical Education) classes were using specialized applications like CAD, Project Lead the Way, and Photoshop all programs that were only accessible via computer labs during school hours. Fife began exploring how they could offer students access to these programs at any time on their 1:1 devices.</p>

          <p>Coastal communities in the Southern United States are frequently impacted by flooding from storm surge, rain, and tides. To help monitor and enhance flood emergency preparedness, the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) at the College of William &amp; Mary has been providing tidal forecasts since 2012 for a dozen locations in the lower Chesapeake Bay through its VIMS TideWatch Network. To expand and enhance these capabilities along Virginias seaside Eastern Shore, VIMS developed StormSense. The StormSense project works closely with coastal local governments leveraging a network of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled water level sensors, VIMSs hydrodynamic flood modeling and forecasting capabilities, and the VIMS TideWatch Network to improve flood resilience in the region.</p>

          <p>To celebrate Computer Science Education week and the Global Hour of Code, AWS Educate has launched a new experience for students between the ages of 14-17. Students now have access to a new website experience and three new badges with learning content to discover and grow their cloud expertise. The website offers a dynamic, streamlined navigational experience so students can easily dive into interactive challenges and hands-on activities. Teachers can also access supplemental guides for the challenges that map to core computer science principles, enabling both students and teachers to explore, invent, and build.</p>

          <p>This week, the BBC and other media outlets published inaccurate stories attempting to connect the AWS bid for the US Department of Defenses Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) Contract to a UK-based investment firm called C5 Capital (C5). To be clear, neither C5 nor any of its subsidiaries are involved in AWS JEDI bid. At no time, past or present, has Amazon or AWS ever invested in C5, its private equity fund, or any related portfolio companies. C5 has never been a teaming partner or subcontractor, nor lobbied on behalf of AWS in order for AWS to obtain government contracts. Any suggestion to the contrary is false. Below are simply the facts so people arent confused.</p>

          <p>At the center of the AWS technical community are community-led AWS Meetups or User Groups now over 300 in more than 75 countries. These groups meet regularly to learn about AWS products and services, network with others, gain programming best practices, and more. As these communities continue to expand, its exciting to see new communities being formed in smaller, emerging markets, as well as ones focused on underrepresented communities. This fall, AWS launched a diversity scholarship program, inviting engineers to re:Invent on a full scholarship who help lead or co-lead an AWS-focused User Group in an emerging market who also identify with an underrepresented community.</p>

          <p>Healthcare providers suffer from having to purchase hardware, storage, and licenses, and then renewing all of that when they become deprecated. They have to think ahead how much they plan to grow and then make large purchases considering that growth, which may turn out to be over or under estimated. Effort is spent on matters that are not core to the healthcare business. One of the main solutions for patients care is the PACs (Picture Archiving and Communication System). This solution is responsible for storing, retrieving, presenting, and sharing medical images, like X-Rays, CT scans, MRIs, and Ultrasounds. Durability, availability, and lowering expenditures are top priorities for companies hosting PACs solutions.</p>

          <p>The reality is just 10 percent of an enterprise blockchain solution is the blockchain network itself. There are many other application, data, and infrastructure components required to build a complete production-ready business solution. The Kaleido Marketplace is a catalog of supplementary ledger services, third-party applications, and AWS integration services. This makes Kaleido a full-stack cloud-based platform for enterprise blockchains that can accelerate the entire journey from POC to production.</p>

          <p>My grandma is 88-years old with reduced mobility. She lives alone, without a caretaker, in a small village. If she falls, then she is in danger. If something goes wrong when shes in bed, she might need assistance. With an AWS IoT button, she can call for help in a simple way and potentially save her life. Her village provides free Wi-Fi coverage, so I built an emergency alert system using AWS. When she clicks the AWS IoT button, a series of events will take place to get her the assistance she needs. This can help her in difficult situations. Its a solution that others can create as well. In this blog post, Ill show you how to get started.</p>

          <p>By their very nature, embedded applications have to be very tightly written because the microcontrollers used in embedded designs are very resource-constrained. When companies build embedded applications that work with AWS, they look to IAR Systems to provide highly-optimized development tools. In this post, we discuss how IAR Systems provides not only the tools but the insights to help customers deliver optimized products faster leveraging Amazon FreeRTOS.</p>

          <p>At AWS re:Invent 2018, the AWS Lambda team launched Lambda Layers and the Lambda Runtime API. Lambda Layers enables you to centrally manage code and data that is shared across multiple functions. And the Runtime API provides a simple interface to use any programming language, or a specific language version, for developing your functions. APN Partners were integral to making these launches a success, providing both Layers and runtimes that help customers build on serverless.</p>

          <p>Gut microbiome plays a critical role in building our immune system at birth. It provides a life-long personal and natural protection. To fully explore and characterize the role of the human gut microbiome, Enterome uses different approaches, including the latest genome sequencing technologies, to reconstruct microbial genomes and quantify the abundance of different species and microbial genes in the gut across large cohorts of patients. The current high throughput sequencing technologies produce tens of millions of DNA sequences for each biological sample and the human gut microbiome is estimated to contain hundreds of species and several million unique bacterial genes that can be identified and analyzed. Enteromes mission is to translate all of this information into actual knowledge, which can be applied to advanced clinical and drug discovery programs.</p>
