          <p>Most AWS CloudFormation templates use parameters to enable customization. It&#8217;s important to validate parameters to ensure a good user experience. AWS CloudFormation gives you several ways to perform parameter validation. For example, you can specify AllowedValues or a Default, or you can assign Types. For more information on validating parameters, see the documentation. Often, developers [...]</p>

          <p>Cyber-attacks are going to happen; vulnerabilities and exploits are going to be identified. Having a solid security-in-depth strategy, coupled with the right tools and people that understand how to respond, will put your company in stronger position to minimize exposure and risk. AWS has security-in-depth strategies for their global infrastructure that cover processes, people, and technology that protect the physical and foundational layers of their offering.</p>

          <p>At the center of the AWS technical community are community-led AWS Meetups or User Groups - now over 300 in more than 75 countries. These groups meet regularly to learn about AWS products and services, network with others, gain programming best practices, and more. As these communities continue to expand, it&#8217;s exciting to see new communities being formed in smaller, emerging markets, as well as ones focused on underrepresented communities. This fall, AWS launched a diversity scholarship program, inviting engineers to re:Invent on a full scholarship who help lead or co-lead an AWS-focused User Group in an emerging market who also identify with an underrepresented community.</p>

          <p>Healthcare providers suffer from having to purchase hardware, storage, and licenses, and then renewing all of that when they become deprecated. They have to think ahead how much they plan to grow and then make large purchases considering that growth, which may turn out to be over or under estimated. Effort is spent on matters that are not core to the healthcare business. One of the main solutions for patient&#8217;s care is the PACs (Picture Archiving and Communication System). This solution is responsible for storing, retrieving, presenting, and sharing medical images, like X-Rays, CT scans, MRIs, and Ultrasounds. Durability, availability, and lowering expenditures are top priorities for companies hosting PACs solutions.</p>

          <p>My grandma is 88-years old with reduced mobility. She lives alone, without a caretaker, in a small village. If she falls, then she is in danger. If something goes wrong when she&#8217;s in bed, she might need assistance. With an AWS IoT button, she can call for help in a simple way and potentially save her life. Her village provides free Wi-Fi coverage, so I built an emergency alert system using AWS. When she clicks the AWS IoT button, a series of events will take place to get her the assistance she needs. This can help her in difficult situations. It&#8217;s a solution that others can create as well. In this blog post, I&#8217;ll show you how to get started.</p>

          <p>By their very nature, embedded applications have to be very tightly written because the microcontrollers used in embedded designs are very resource-constrained. When companies build embedded applications that work with AWS, they look to IAR Systems to provide highly-optimized development tools. In this post, we discuss how IAR Systems provides not only the tools but the insights to help customers deliver optimized products faster leveraging Amazon FreeRTOS.</p>

          <p>At AWS re:Invent 2018, the AWS Lambda team launched Lambda Layers and the Lambda Runtime API. Lambda Layers enables you to centrally manage code and data that is shared across multiple functions. And the Runtime API provides a simple interface to use any programming language, or a specific language version, for developing your functions. APN Partners were integral to making these launches a success, providing both Layers and runtimes that help customers build on serverless.</p>

          <p>Gut microbiome plays a critical role in building our immune system at birth. It provides a life-long personal and natural protection. To fully explore and characterize the role of the human gut microbiome, Enterome uses different approaches, including the latest genome sequencing technologies, to reconstruct microbial genomes and quantify the abundance of different species and microbial genes in the gut across large cohorts of patients. The current high throughput sequencing technologies produce tens of millions of DNA sequences for each biological sample and the human gut microbiome is estimated to contain hundreds of species and several million unique bacterial genes that can be identified and analyzed. Enterome&#8217;s mission is to translate all of this information into actual knowledge, which can be applied to advanced clinical and drug discovery programs.</p>
