First, we use SAML federation where user credentials were stored in Active Directory. Second, we use a custom credentials provider library to enable cross-account access. And third, we use an EC2 Instance Profile role to provide temporary credentials for users in our organization to access Athena.</p>

          <p>Recife, the capital of Brazils northeastern state of Pernambuco, is distinguished by its many rivers, bridges, islets, and peninsulas.

          <p>Transportation and traffic management are hot topics when city planners and administrations think about ways to make a city smarter and more livable. Recent statistics tell us that drivers in the U.S. spend an average of 42 hours per year in traffic in cities and lose $1,400 on gas, while idling. In Europe, cities like London and Paris show an average of 74 and 69 hours spent idling per year respectively. Researchers in England found adding an additional 20 minutes of commuting per day has the same negative effect on job satisfaction as receiving a 19% pay cut. These statistics and an increasing desire to be more environment friendly are reasons why city leaders are looking to tackle this problem.</p>
