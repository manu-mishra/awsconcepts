          <p>Just as television transitioned from black and white to color, the web has been moving from a text-based medium to one dominated by sound and vision. Accordingly, content creation has both exploded and changed. Publishers of all types are struggling through this transition as they try to meet the demands of users while keeping their business models intact.
On-demand audio is attracting significant interest from publishers as mobile listening grows and in-car technology begins to disrupt traditional radio. This trend is most visible in the mainstream adoption of podcasts. But podcasts are just the beginning of a rapidly emerging, and diverse, ecosystem of new digital audio formats. Amazon Echo and advanced text-to-speech services such as Amazon Polly are enabling the creation of these new audio products.
In this blog post we describe how Spokata leverages these Amazon technologies to make text-based news and information universally accessible as real-time audio.</p>

          <p>By establishing a data warehouse strategy using Amazon S3 for storage and Redshift Spectrum for analytics, we increased the size of the datasets we support by over an order of magnitude. In addition, we improved our ability to ingest large volumes of data quickly, and maintained fast performance without increasing our costs. Our analysts and modelers can now perform deeper analytics to improve ad buying strategies and results.</p>
