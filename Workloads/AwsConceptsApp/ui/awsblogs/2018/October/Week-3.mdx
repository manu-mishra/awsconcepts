          <p>Data cataloging is an important part of many analytical systems. The AWS Glue Data Catalog provides integration with a wide number of tools. Using the Data Catalog, you also can specify a policy that grants permissions to objects in the Data Catalog. Data lakes require detailed access control at both the content level and the level of the metadata describing the content. In this post, we show how you can define the access policies for the metadata in the catalog.</p>
