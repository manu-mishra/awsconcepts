          <p> One of the biggest challenges enterprises face is setting up and maintaining a reliable extract, transform, and load (ETL) process to extract value and insight from data. Traditional ETL tools are complex to use, and can take months to implement, test, and deploy. After the ETL jobs are built, maintaining them can be painful [...]</p>

          <p>Pressure on schools to provide more Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) resources to students, combined with the needs of business for a properly trained 21st century workforce have driven Marmion Academy to create the Computational Prototyping and Research Center (CPARC).</p>

          <p>Previously, I published a post detailing the differences between the Amazon EC2 instance types available on AWS. This time, Im not going to focus on the differences between the instance types. Instead, I focus on how to pick the right instance type for you. One size fits all? Id love to be able to end [...]</p>

          <p>With recent advances in CPU and GPU technology, training complex and deep neural network models in a few hours is within reach for many state of-the-art deep models. However, when you use a system with such high processing throughput potential, the required data for the processing pipeline must be ready before each iteration.</p>
