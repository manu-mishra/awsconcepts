          <p>Last week, we held our first-ever AWS Public Sector Summit in Europe. Customers from over 40 countries traveled to Brussels to hear from leaders across the public sector about how they use the cloud to build a digital generation. Teresa Carlson, VP of Worldwide Public Sector at AWS, delivered a keynote highlighting how public sector organizations are taking on the role of builders on behalf of their citizens. Santillana, European Commission, and Skinvision took the stage to share how they are creating new citizen services, improving the delivery and performance of existing programs, and making data-driven decisions.</p>
