          <p>Weve become so accustomed to the existence of skyscrapers, road networks, oil rigs, hydroelectric dams, nuclear power plants, wind turbines, suspension bridges, and all the other incredible feats of human engineering populating our world, that some might overlook the remarkable effort that goes into their construction. These projects are not built by robots. A huge amount of human effort is required to bring them into existence, in addition to the technology used to design, streamline, and improve processes.
Initiafy makes the workforce element of projects more productive and efficient. Heavy industry projects rely on contractors, with related management challenges of handling documents, health and safety, and quality control. Initiafy provides contractor management on an online platform, giving workers training in a flexible way and ensuring standards are high across a contingent workforce. Initiafy operates in a number of countries, with workers coming from a number of nationalities so it is vital that training is accessible for all workers.</p>
