          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) charted their path to the cloud back in 2012 with the cloud directive. Since then, they have made strides in accelerating the adoption of cloud computing throughout the department. Critical to the success of cloud adoption is training the warfighter on how to use the new technology. What better way to train soldiers in the cloud, than through a &#8220;born-in-the-cloud&#8221; startup. The Data Incubator is a growing startup and AWS Partner Network (APN) member who not only uses AWS, but also trains defense agencies on how to use AWS tools in the cloud across all data classification levels.</p>

          <p>When one of Australia&#8217;s largest general insurers, Insurance &amp; Care NSW (icare), was looking for an urgent solution to relieve pressure on their constrained internal network and Internet links, they turned to Cloudten Industries, an APN Advanced Consulting Partner with the AWS Government Competency. Cloudten helped alleviate the load on icare&#8217;s internal network while allowing the business to meet its project deadlines for Office 365 migration.</p>

          <p>There are many arguments for building a serverless architecture. Chief among them, users only pay for the computing power they use. Organizations can begin by identifying and eliminating the bottlenecks in their workflow. For example, CSIRO Bioinformatics in Sydney, Australia, used AWS X-Ray to systematically evaluate their serverless architecture and, by doing so, improved their runtime by 80%.</p>

          <p>In this blog post, I present a solution that exports system tables from multiple Amazon Redshift clusters into an Amazon S3 bucket. This solution is serverless, and you can schedule it as frequently as every five minutes. The AWS CloudFormation deployment template that I provide automates the solution setup in your environment. The system tables&#8217; data in the Amazon S3 bucket is partitioned by cluster name and query execution date to enable efficient joins in cross-cluster diagnostic queries.</p>
