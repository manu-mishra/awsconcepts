          <p>Like many startups today, Nummo was born in the cloud and given our industry and our future goals, we wouldn&#8217;t compromise any other aspects of our offering. People needed to feel their data is secure when using Nummo.</p>

          <p>Exams can be stressful for students, but the performance of their testing platform should not be a concern. Students expect the same level of tech they are used to in their daily lives, so universities must keep pace. In 2010, the founders of UNIwise, at the time working in managing positions at Aarhus University in Denmark, identified a student desire to bring and use their own computers for exams. At that time, no technology was available that would prevent cheating and plagiarism during digital exams.</p>

Coventry University has been on a continuous cycle of reinvention over the past 175 years - from its origins as the Coventry School of Design in 1843 through to its growth as a technical college in 1902. Having gained university status in 1992, Coventry&#8217;s reinvention has led it to become the top modern university in the UK.</p>

          <p>Accelario is database migration software that provides a fast and easy way to load an Oracle database to Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the end of the initial load, database synchronization starts immediately using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS), and the result is a zero downtime migration of your database.
Businesses that require 24/7 operation face a significant issue when moving databases into the cloud: Up until now, few if any cost-effective options existed to minimize the resulting downtime. With its recent integration with AWS DMS, Accelario provides a ready-to-use, zero downtime, full database migration solution&#8212;meaning that the whole database is migrated, including users, procedures, views, etc. When the process is done, you can access your database and start using it with your application immediately.</p>
