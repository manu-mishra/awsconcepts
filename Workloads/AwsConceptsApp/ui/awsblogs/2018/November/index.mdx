          <p>At Tableau Conference 2018, we announced a new AWS Quick Start: Tableau Server on AWS for Healthcare. This lets customers quickly deploy Tableau Server on AWS in a manner that is preconfigured with common security and compliance controls, such as encryption at-rest and in-transit, and support their compliance objectives out of the box. The Quick Start comes with a jointly authored security controls reference describing how different parts of the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rules apply to AWS and Tableau.</p>

          <p>Since we launched Amazon Redshift, thousands of customers have trusted us to get uncompromising speed for their most complex analytical workloads. Over the course of 2017, our customers benefited from a 3x to 5x performance gain, resulting from short query acceleration, result caching, late materialization, and many other under-the-hood improvements.

          <p>To help you prepare for AWS re:Invent 2018, weve rounded up a number of things to check out while you are in Las Vegas. Please join us for the Global Partner Summit, which provides APN Partners with opportunities to connect, collaborate, and discover. Youll learn how to leverage AWS technologies to serve your customers, and how the APN program can help build and grow your business. This year, GPS sessions will take place throughout the week across the entire re:Invent campus.</p>

          <p>As organizations expand analytics practices and hire data scientists and other specialized roles, big data pipelines are growing increasingly complex. Sophisticated models are being built using the troves of data being collected every second. The bottleneck today is often not the know-how of analytical techniques. Rather, its the difficulty of building and maintaining ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs using tools that might be unsuitable for the cloud. In this post, I demonstrate a solution to this challenge.</p>

          <p>On October 19, 2018, at the California Cloud Workforce (CA Cloud) launch event, over a hundred Los Angeles-based education, government, and business leaders came together with a shared mission: develop cloud career pathways for all students to promote opportunity and economic growth. Hosted by CA Cloud, a consortium of 19 L.A. County community colleges and their sister high schools, the event aimed to build and maintain momentum around the launch of the consortium and the Cloud Computing Certificate. The five-course, dual enrollment Cloud Computing Certificate, created with AWS Educate, serves as a valuable talent pipeline for employers in need of cloud-skilled workers across all sectors.</p>

          <p>What are two main things that all SaaS companies need to be sure to think about? While there is likely a laundry list of such items, a culture of creativity and security should be top of mind, at least according to Adam Fitzgerald, Head of Worldwide Developer Marketing at AWS, and Nicolas Dessaigne, Co-Founder and CEO of Algolia.</p>

          <p>The nature of data has changed dramatically. Just a decade back, the majority of our data was structured (residing in relational databases) or textual. Now, with the advent of self-driving vehicles, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT), images and video data are taking the lions share of the data storage zoo. As we create more and more data on more and more devices, however, this problem is not going away. In fact, we have reached a point where there arent enough people on the planet to label all the data were creating.</p>

          <p>Companies struggling with data science dont understand the data science life cycle. As a result, they fall into the trap of the model myth. This is the mistake of thinking that because data scientists work in code, the same processes that works for building software will work for building models. Models are different, and the wrong approach leads to trouble. Domino Data Lab shares that organizations excelling at data science are those that understand it as a unique endeavor, requiring a new approach.</p>

Driving business outcomes with AI doesnt need to be overwhelming. Its all about exploring which business problems you want to solve, how good predictions can help you achieve those outcomes, and then taking practical steps to get there while implementing an organization-wide AI strategy.</p>

Driven by the need for greater productivity and lower costs, organizations around the world are moving their workloads to the cloud. Pre-migration planning can be as important as the implementation work itself. A cloud readiness assessment can transform an organizations rough idea of moving to the cloud into a detailed plan that explains how to make it happen and in what order events should occur.</p>

          <p>Dome9sintegration with Amazon GuardDuty brings to the table a way of surfacing security findings, providing context and creating automated remediations. Users that identify a finding can look through their Dome9 console and pinpoint the exact instance, VPC, and security group associated with it. This helps customers identify the compromised instance, as well as potential instances that may have a similar posture, thereby allowing you to mitigate the risk before exposure.</p>

          <p>Imagine this scenario: its the last day to file a business permit renewal. You are a small business owner who goes online, completes a renewal form, and clicks submit. Behind the scenes, processing ensues. While you wait for the business permit to be processed, you wonder why the system doesnt instantly accept and approve your form. Why not have the back-end processing take place separately so you can receive a notification a few minutes later with your permit attached?</p>

          <p>Sharing data requires more than just making it available for download or creating an API to access it. In many ways, sharing data is similar to shipping a software product. Just like software; data is made up of digital information; it requires documentation; it will be used by groups of users who may require support; and it may become vital to those users work. Another common characteristic of software is that it often gets updated over time as software developers learn from their users and adapt to new technologies.</p>

          <p>Exams can be stressful for students, but the performance of their testing platform should not be a concern. Students expect the same level of tech they are used to in their daily lives, so universities must keep pace.

At that time, no technology was available that would prevent cheating and plagiarism during digital exams.</p>

          <p>Coventry Universitys logo includes the Phoenix, which mirrors the universitys ability to reinvent itself. Coventry University has been on a continuous cycle of reinvention over the past 175 years from its origins as the Coventry School of Design in 1843 through to its growth as a technical college in 1902. Having gained university status in 1992, Coventrys reinvention has led it to become the top modern university in the UK.</p>

          <p>Accelario is database migration software that provides a fast and easy way to load an Oracle database to Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the end of the initial load, database synchronization starts immediately using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS), and the result is a zero downtime migration of your database.
Businesses that require 24/7 operation face a significant issue when moving databases into the cloud: Up until now, few if any cost-effective options existed to minimize the resulting downtime. With its recent integration with AWS DMS, Accelario provides a ready-to-use, zero downtime, full database migration solutionmeaning that the whole database is migrated, including users, procedures, views, etc. When the process is done, you can access your database and start using it with your application immediately.</p>

          <p>Satellites are used by an increasing number universities and governments for applications including weather, surface imaging, communications, and video broadcasts. To do this today, they must build or obtain long-term leases on ground antennas to communicate with the satellites. This is a significant undertaking and cost because customers often require antennas in multiple countries to maintain satellite connectivity. Beginning with the recently announced AWS Ground Station, customers can save up to 80% of their ground station costs by only paying for satellite communications when their organization needs them.</p>
