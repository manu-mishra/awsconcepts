          <p>Keeping the AWS cloud operating efficiently worldwide is a big job. The team is growing rapidly, and its important that new leaders internalize the high bar we set for service operations, and that our senior leaders are able to periodically inspect whats happening deep in the stack. For over ten years, one of our mechanisms [...]</p>

          <p>At Tableau Conference 2018, we announced a new AWS Quick Start: Tableau Server on AWS for Healthcare. This lets customers quickly deploy Tableau Server on AWS in a manner that is preconfigured with common security and compliance controls, such as encryption at-rest and in-transit, and support their compliance objectives out of the box. The Quick Start comes with a jointly authored security controls reference describing how different parts of the HIPAA Security and Privacy Rules apply to AWS and Tableau.</p>

          <p>Since we launched Amazon Redshift, thousands of customers have trusted us to get uncompromising speed for their most complex analytical workloads. Over the course of 2017, our customers benefited from a 3x to 5x performance gain, resulting from short query acceleration, result caching, late materialization, and many other under-the-hood improvements.

          <p>As organizations expand analytics practices and hire data scientists and other specialized roles, big data pipelines are growing increasingly complex. Sophisticated models are being built using the troves of data being collected every second. The bottleneck today is often not the know-how of analytical techniques. Rather, its the difficulty of building and maintaining ETL (extract, transform, and load) jobs using tools that might be unsuitable for the cloud. In this post, I demonstrate a solution to this challenge.</p>

          <p>On October 19, 2018, at the California Cloud Workforce (CA Cloud) launch event, over a hundred Los Angeles-based education, government, and business leaders came together with a shared mission: develop cloud career pathways for all students to promote opportunity and economic growth. Hosted by CA Cloud, a consortium of 19 L.A. County community colleges and their sister high schools, the event aimed to build and maintain momentum around the launch of the consortium and the Cloud Computing Certificate. The five-course, dual enrollment Cloud Computing Certificate, created with AWS Educate, serves as a valuable talent pipeline for employers in need of cloud-skilled workers across all sectors.</p>
