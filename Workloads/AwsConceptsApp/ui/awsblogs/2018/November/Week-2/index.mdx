          <p>The nature of data has changed dramatically. Just a decade back, the majority of our data was structured (residing in relational databases) or textual. Now, with the advent of self-driving vehicles, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT), images and video data are taking the lion&#8217;s share of the data storage zoo. As we create more and more data on more and more devices, however, this problem is not going away. In fact, we have reached a point where there aren&#8217;t enough people on the planet to label all the data we&#8217;re creating.</p>

          <p>Companies struggling with data science don&#8217;t understand the data science life cycle. As a result, they fall into the trap of the model myth. This is the mistake of thinking that because data scientists work in code, the same processes that works for building software will work for building models. Models are different, and the wrong approach leads to trouble. Domino Data Lab shares that organizations excelling at data science are those that understand it as a unique endeavor, requiring a new approach.</p>

          <p>Do you want to become more familiar with how your company can use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) but feel a bit lost amongst the buzzwords and hype? Driving business outcomes with AI doesn&#8217;t need to be overwhelming. It&#8217;s all about exploring which business problems you want to solve, how good predictions can help you achieve those outcomes, and then taking practical steps to get there while implementing an organization-wide AI strategy.</p>

          <p>The new online Cloud Readiness Assessment tool is a self-guided checklist to gauge your level of preparedness for a smooth transition to the cloud. Driven by the need for greater productivity and lower costs, organizations around the world are moving their workloads to the cloud. Pre-migration planning can be as important as the implementation work itself. A cloud readiness assessment can transform an organization&#8217;s rough idea of moving to the cloud into a detailed plan that explains how to make it happen and in what order events should occur.</p>

          <p>An interesting question arose at one of my customer meetings recently. We were discussing the importance of innovation; in particular, how important it was for technology staff to stay abreast of new technologies to see whether they could add value to the enterprise. We agreed that current best practices suggest conducting rapid experiments to test [...]</p>

          <p>If you ask a developer what they think of marketing, it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll get a very positive response. Why? For the most part, they&#8217;re tired of marketers telling them how awesome a product is. They have a healthy skepticism, in that they just don&#8217;t believe the messaging. But what if your target market is developers? How do you attract them to&#8212;and keep them using&#8212;your platform?</p>

          <p>Sam Parnell has been an AWS evangelist most of his career. While Chief Technology Officer at popular sports news site Bleacher Report, he ran the company &#8220;100 percent on AWS.&#8221; When Turner Broadcasting acquired Bleacher Report in 2012, Parnell got involved with aspects of the media giant&#8217;s infrastructure, and again started moving critical operations into the cloud.</p>

          <p>Imagine this scenario: it&#8217;s the last day to file a business permit renewal. You are a small business owner who goes online, completes a renewal form, and clicks &#8220;submit.&#8221; Behind the scenes, processing ensues. While you wait for the business permit to be processed, you wonder why the system doesn&#8217;t instantly accept and approve your form. Why not have the back-end processing take place separately so you can receive a notification a few minutes later with your permit attached?</p>
