          <p>Exams can be stressful for students, but the performance of their testing platform should not be a concern. Students expect the same level of tech they are used to in their daily lives, so universities must keep pace. In 2010, the founders of UNIwise, at the time working in managing positions at Aarhus University in Denmark, identified a student desire to bring and use their own computers for exams. At that time, no technology was available that would prevent cheating and plagiarism during digital exams.</p>

          <p>Accelario is database migration software that provides a fast and easy way to load an Oracle database to Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the end of the initial load, database synchronization starts immediately using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS), and the result is a zero downtime migration of your database.
Businesses that require 24/7 operation face a significant issue when moving databases into the cloud: Up until now, few if any cost-effective options existed to minimize the resulting downtime. With its recent integration with AWS DMS, Accelario provides a ready-to-use, zero downtime, full database migration solutionmeaning that the whole database is migrated, including users, procedures, views, etc. When the process is done, you can access your database and start using it with your application immediately.</p>
