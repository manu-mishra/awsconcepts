          <p>Government agencies often look to promote new technology for cost-savings and efficiency but it doesnt stop there. The second and third-tier effects of technology can be long-lasting for citizens, businesses, and economies. Our recent whitepaper, 5 Ways the Cloud Can Drive Economic Development, outlines the internal transformation most public institutions experience as a first benefit of cloud adoption. In other words, the cloud drives greater accessibility of data, information sharing, increased productivity, and smarter resource allocation inside the organization.</p>

          <p>Sharing data requires more than just making it available for download or creating an API to access it. In many ways, sharing data is similar to shipping a software product. Just like software; data is made up of digital information; it requires documentation; it will be used by groups of users who may require support; and it may become vital to those users work. Another common characteristic of software is that it often gets updated over time as software developers learn from their users and adapt to new technologies.</p>
