          <p>At AWS re:Invent 2017, we introduced the AWS Serverless Application Repository that enables AWS customers to easily discover, deploy, and publish serverless apps for data processing, stream processing, Internet of Things (IoT) device data telemetry, and more. The Splunk AWS Serverless Applications are available from the AWS Lambda console and allow customers to ingest TBs of data into Splunk. Check out the Splunk serverless apps that are open-sourced to dive deeper, including the underlying AWS SAM template.</p>

          <p>While most people know Rent the Runway as the countrys leading lender of LBDs and workwear, the nine-year old startup also happens to be the countrys largest dry-cleaning business. As Rent The Runway CTO Josh Builder notes, the company turns around, on average, 50,000 to 55,000 items on a daily basisover 65,000 during peak seasons and holidaysand 100% of that inventory comes back to them.
As veritable stylists and dry-cleaning experts, Rent the Runway must keep track of not only the latest fashion trends, but also a wide variety of inventory and chemical mixes to keep their clothes in red-carpet shape. To do this, RTR is shifting many of their operations to the cloud. Watch to see how they pulled it off.</p>

The point is, things end badly. There was no way Pouch cofounder Vikram Simha was letting any of that happen.</p>

For the most part, consumers dont understandnor carewhether they are getting a discount or new product notice from a brands email or app team.
