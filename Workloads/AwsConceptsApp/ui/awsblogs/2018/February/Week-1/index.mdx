However, after nearly 30 years, Photoshops licensing model is being challenged by several startups looking to democratize the design industry and make it easier for all people, and not just professionals, to create. One such startup is San Francisco-based Figma. Founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, the open design platformwhich just raised a $25 million Series Bfeatures a cloud-based screen design tool, which helps teams achieve a shared understanding around design without worrying about syncing, exporting or installing software.

As evidenced by the full range of our Authorizations-To-Operate, third-party attestations, and certifications, the AWS Cloud provides government customers with the only one-stop shop to handle Public, For Official Use Only (FOUO), Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret workloads.</p>
