          <p>Every year since 1964, the month of February has been designated as American Heart Monthand for good reason.

To encourage people to take steps toward a healthy heart and prevent heart disease, the American Heart Association (AHA) is dedicated to breaking down siloes in cardiovascular research and making datasets available to more scientists than ever. Their Precision Medicine Platform, powered by AWS, does exactly that.</p>
