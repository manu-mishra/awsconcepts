          <p>Initially released on February 19, 1990, Adobes Photoshop has long been the doyen of design. However, after nearly 30 years, Photoshops licensing model is being challenged by several startups looking to democratize the design industry and make it easier for all people, and not just professionals, to create. One such startup is San Francisco-based Figma. Founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, the open design platformwhich just raised a $25 million Series Bfeatures a cloud-based screen design tool, which helps teams achieve a shared understanding around design without worrying about syncing, exporting or installing software. We recently caught up with Field to talk about how the cloud has made life easier for designers.</p>

          <p>Cloud technology continues to be a major catalyst in how the federal government can achieve operational efficiencies and innovate on demand to advance their mission. Many government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD) and other agencies with mission-critical workloads, are using AWSs utility-based cloud offerings to process, store, and transmit federal government data. As evidenced by the full range of our Authorizations-To-Operate, third-party attestations, and certifications, the AWS Cloud provides government customers with the only one-stop shop to handle Public, For Official Use Only (FOUO), Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret workloads.</p>

To do this, RTR is shifting many of their operations to the cloud. Watch to see how they pulled it off.</p>

          <p>Whether its via phones, cars, speakers, or even watches, brands have an ever-increasing number of places to reach consumers. The catch, however, is that consumers are getting savvierand more demandingabout how brands are engaging with them. Customers have high expectations that brands are going to deliver relevant, personalized, and important messages to them that add a lot of value, says Braze co-founder and chief technology officer Jon Hyman. For the most part, consumers dont understandnor carewhether they are getting a discount or new product notice from a brands email or app team. All they care about is: is it delivering a great product experience, is it valuable to me, is it adding value, and is it relevant to me, he says.</p>

          <p>Twitter has hundreds of millions of active users each month and supports multiple languages on their platform. These users engage with nonprofits, need citizen services, and learn at schools, universities, and other educational institutions. As a consequence, public sector organizations look to social media not only to communicate with the public, but also to gain insights about the citizens, volunteers, and students they serve. Wouldnt it be great to know if people had positive or negative opinions about your city, school, nonprofit, or organization? What are they talking about and how many other people share that view?</p>

A prevailing theme that emerged cast the opioid epidemic as an issue of public health rather than one of criminal justice and pressed the role of technology in mitigating its risks.</p>
