          <p>As the move towards cloud accelerates, unsubstantiated fears about security are inhibiting the use of cloud services by some enterprises. A vital element of a successful cloud migration is understanding shared responsibilities between the organization and cloud service provider. Ixias CloudLens has a serverless architecture that scales with distributed software systems built for cloud scale, which delivers intelligent, resilient, and proactive cloud visibility.</p>

          <p>VMware Cloud on AWS enables customers to extend their on-premises data centers and easily migrate application workloads without having to convert machine image formats or undergo a re-platforming process. Customers no longer have to over-provision hardware resources to accommodate for host failures. Instead, they can increase utilization of the cluster resources, as host failure replacement takes minutes, not days or weeks. In this post, we dive deeper into the foundational blocks that make up this service.</p>

A VMware hybrid-cloud solution offers a compatible, interoperable environment with full workload portability so that you can rapidly move to a public cloud service without making any changes to your applications. This is ideal for disaster recovery, dev/test environments, data center consolidation, rapid project delivery, or simply getting out of the data center business.</p>

          <p>The University of Arizona addressed the challenge of creating a more efficient and agile IT operation by deciding to go all-in on the cloud. After initial success in migrating their Kuali Research Administration system, they created a roadmap and began migrating their PeopleSoft application environments, including Enterprise Learning (EL), Human Resources (HR), and Student Administration (SA) to AWS. The University of Arizona has 42,000 students with more than 300 majors. To be responsive to their students, they are in the process of migrating over 95 enterprise services to the cloud.</p>
