          <p>As the move towards cloud accelerates, unsubstantiated fears about security are inhibiting the use of cloud services by some enterprises. A vital element of a successful cloud migration is understanding shared responsibilities between the organization and cloud service provider. Ixias CloudLens has a serverless architecture that scales with distributed software systems built for cloud scale, which delivers intelligent, resilient, and proactive cloud visibility.</p>

          <p>VMware Cloud on AWS enables customers to extend their on-premises data centers and easily migrate application workloads without having to convert machine image formats or undergo a re-platforming process. Customers no longer have to over-provision hardware resources to accommodate for host failures. Instead, they can increase utilization of the cluster resources, as host failure replacement takes minutes, not days or weeks. In this post, we dive deeper into the foundational blocks that make up this service.</p>
