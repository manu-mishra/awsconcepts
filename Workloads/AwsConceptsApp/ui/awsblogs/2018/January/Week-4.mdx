          <p>Many AWS customers run mission-critical workloads using the IBM Db2 database platform. Typically, these workloads require a highly available configuration to make sure that the database is available in the event of a node or site failure. The traditional IBM method to achieve high availability is to use shared storage and virtual IP addresses, which [...]</p>

          <p>AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) now supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints powered by AWS PrivateLink. This means you now can connect directly to AWS KMS through a private endpoint in your VPC, keeping all traffic within your VPC and the AWS network. Previously, applications running inside a VPC required internet access [...]</p>

          <p>With the availability of Wi-Fi and Chromebooks in the classroom, students are better positioned than ever before to take advantage of digital learning tools. However, Chromebooks dont easily support demanding software, such as CAD/CAM and other tools needed for Science Technology Education and Math (STEM) classes. So while a classroom may have ubiquitous access to the internet, teachers who require more robust desktop applications and software still find themselves reserving time in school computer labs.</p>

          <p>As federal IT leaders recognize the major benefits of cloud computing, some worry that the efficiencies of the cloud will result in sacrificing the workforce that has powered IT for years. In reality, though, federal government technology employees can experience greater empowerment with new technology tools that allow them to focus on strategic, innovative, mission-critical work. By equipping staff with cloud computing capabilities and the confidence to take on new responsibilities, government agencies invite fresh ideas, a place to test them, and the potential to solve complex issues affecting the environment in which they operate.</p>
