          <p>AWS Config enables continuous monitoring of your AWS resources, making it simple to assess, audit, and record resource configurations and changes. AWS Config does this through the use of rules that define the desired configuration state of your AWS resources. AWS Config provides a number of AWS managed rules that address a wide range of [...]</p>

          <p>Lambda@Edge provides you with the ability to bring compute power closer to client applications. With the recent increase in function limits and ability to send binary responses, as well as the addition of remote calling from functions, the capabilities of Lambda@Edge have grown. This post demonstrates how you can take an application with a relatively slow rate of changing data and use Lambda@Edge to both provide low latency data to application clients and remove unnecessary calls to a backend service.</p>

          <p>We are excited to share three new how-to guides featuring best practices for creating and uploading architecture diagrams, case studies and customer references, and microsites. Each guide provides clear benefits to Partners for building these assets and explains why the APN asks for them in applications for AWS Service Delivery, AWS Competency, and AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Programs. The how-to guides also detail how the APN uses Partner-submitted documentation and gives a few examples approved by the APN.</p>

          <p>Since AWS has announced that all our services comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we wanted to explore some of the ways AWS can help you on your road to compliance. In this post, we walk through the support AWS offers across the APN as well as the AWS Premium Support and AWS Professional Services organizations. We explain how these teams are working with customers and APN Partners in Europe and around the world to support them with questions related to GDPR and AWS.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has named 17 goals that will help boost sustainable development worldwide. DigitalGlobe worked to find passionate participants who can leverage DigitalGlobes GBDX platform and imagery for geospatial projects supporting work in areas such as disaster response, food security, poverty elimination, and ending malaria. DigitalGlobes GBDX uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud-based access to its entire 100-petabyte imagery library. With the support of AWS, the GBDX for Sustainability Challenge taps into the potential of that vast digital library to support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Extracting meaningful information from satellite imagery at scale is only possible because of the AWS Cloud.</p>

          <p>Ensuring that proper security measures are in place calls for robust security testing mechanisms. GuardiCores Infection Monkey is an open source Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that tests and evaluates the effectiveness of your network security configurations during post-breach attacks. You can simulate a breach by infecting a server with a Monkey that runs around your network using various methods to enter propagation paths and attacks each point of vulnerability it discovers.</p>

          <p>Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Using Amazon Polly you can create applications that talk and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Starting today, you can apply to participate in a developer preview that allows you to use eight English (U.S.) Amazon Polly voices to narrate your Alexa skills. If your skill uses only a single voice today, you can try changing the voice or adding different voices in the right places to provide an even more engaging experience. Developers in the preview can select a different voice for any utterance by constructing output speech using the Structured Speech Markup Language (SSML) and specifying an Amazon Polly voice using the voice tag for free in Alexa skills. Note that SSML tags that are only available through the Amazon Polly service and not through Alexa skills will not be available when you use this new capability.</p>

          <p>While the fires spread in Sonoma County in October 2017, the focus was on fighting the flames that burned more than 110,000 acres and on helping the citizens displaced from their homes get access to emergency response resources. In addition to shelter, food, and water, time was another important resource. Citizens have high expectations for government services, whether at the state or municipal level, especially in the aftermath of a disaster. Immediately following the Sonoma County fires, the staffing resources in place could not handle the demands required to provide services and educate the public on what resources were available. To scale to meet the demands of citizens, QLess, an innovator in customer-interaction management (CIM) technology, worked around the clock to deploy its Amazon Web Services (AWS)-hosted solution for Sonoma County in a single weekend.</p>

          <p>In 2003, the Singapore campus opened with around 300 students, two support staff, and basic IT infrastructure. Fast forward to 2018, and the university now serves more than 3,000 students. With the growth of the university, they realized that what worked for them in the past would not take them where they needed to be in the future. To remain competitive and keep up with the needs of students, faculty, and staff, JCU looked to transform the universitys IT to leverage emerging educational technology. They turned to the AWS Cloud for accessibility, agility, global reach, reliability, and cost savings as they personalized their own digital transformation.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has multiple Identity partitions: AWS, AWS GovCloud (US), and AWS China. You can see these represented in their ARNs (arn:aws, arn:aws-us-gov, arn:aws-cn). For security, services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) do not have access to credentials beyond their boundaries, which can make it difficult to transfer information from inside one Identity boundary to another. There is a new tool though, that reduces time and complexity for customers migrating their workloads into AWS GovCloud (US) gov-cloud-import.</p>
