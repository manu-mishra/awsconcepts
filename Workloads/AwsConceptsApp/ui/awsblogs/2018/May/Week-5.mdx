          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has multiple Identity partitions: AWS, AWS GovCloud (US), and AWS China. You can see these represented in their ARNs (arn:aws, arn:aws-us-gov, arn:aws-cn). For security, services like Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) do not have access to credentials beyond their boundaries, which can make it difficult to transfer information from inside one Identity boundary to another. There is a new tool though, that reduces time and complexity for customers migrating their workloads into AWS GovCloud (US) gov-cloud-import.</p>
