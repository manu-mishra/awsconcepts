          <p>Lambda@Edge provides you with the ability to bring compute power closer to client applications. With the recent increase in function limits and ability to send binary responses, as well as the addition of remote calling from functions, the capabilities of Lambda@Edge have grown. This post demonstrates how you can take an application with a relatively slow rate of changing data and use Lambda@Edge to both provide low latency data to application clients and remove unnecessary calls to a backend service.</p>

          <p>We are excited to share three new how-to guides featuring best practices for creating and uploading architecture diagrams, case studies and customer references, and microsites. Each guide provides clear benefits to Partners for building these assets and explains why the APN asks for them in applications for AWS Service Delivery, AWS Competency, and AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) Programs. The how-to guides also detail how the APN uses Partner-submitted documentation and gives a few examples approved by the APN.</p>
