          <p>You can reap huge analytical value from billions of items and millions of requests per second in your Amazon DynamoDB service.

          <p>While the fires spread in Sonoma County in October 2017, the focus was on fighting the flames that burned more than 110,000 acres and on helping the citizens displaced from their homes get access to emergency response resources. In addition to shelter, food, and water, time was another important resource. Citizens have high expectations for government services, whether at the state or municipal level, especially in the aftermath of a disaster. Immediately following the Sonoma County fires, the staffing resources in place could not handle the demands required to provide services and educate the public on what resources were available. To scale to meet the demands of citizens, QLess, an innovator in customer-interaction management (CIM) technology, worked around the clock to deploy its Amazon Web Services (AWS)-hosted solution for Sonoma County in a single weekend.</p>

          <p>As part of the onboarding process when joining the AWS Service Delivery Program, APN Partners must go through a technical audit of their experience delivering AWS services to end customers. This audit is conducted by internal technical experts who validate the APN Partners knowledge and capabilities for a specific AWS service. To help APN Partners better understand this process, we are introducing Validation Checklists that provide visibility into the criteria we use during an organizations technical validation.</p>

          <p>In 2003, the Singapore campus opened with around 300 students, two support staff, and basic IT infrastructure. Fast forward to 2018, and the university now serves more than 3,000 students. With the growth of the university, they realized that what worked for them in the past would not take them where they needed to be in the future. To remain competitive and keep up with the needs of students, faculty, and staff, JCU looked to transform the universitys IT to leverage emerging educational technology. They turned to the AWS Cloud for accessibility, agility, global reach, reliability, and cost savings as they personalized their own digital transformation.</p>
