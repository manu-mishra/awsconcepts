          <p>Since AWS has announced that all our services comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we wanted to explore some of the ways AWS can help you on your road to compliance. In this post, we walk through the support AWS offers across the APN as well as the AWS Premium Support and AWS Professional Services organizations. We explain how these teams are working with customers and APN Partners in Europe and around the world to support them with questions related to GDPR and AWS.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has named 17 goals that will help boost sustainable development worldwide. DigitalGlobe worked to find passionate participants who can leverage DigitalGlobe&#8217;s GBDX platform and imagery for geospatial projects supporting work in areas such as disaster response, food security, poverty elimination, and ending malaria. DigitalGlobe&#8217;s GBDX uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud-based access to its entire 100-petabyte imagery library. With the support of AWS, the GBDX for Sustainability Challenge taps into the potential of that vast digital library to support the United Nations&#8217; Sustainable Development Goals. Extracting meaningful information from satellite imagery at scale is only possible because of the AWS Cloud.</p>

          <p>Ensuring that proper security measures are in place calls for robust security testing mechanisms. GuardiCore&#8217;s Infection Monkey is an open source Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that tests and evaluates the effectiveness of your network security configurations during post-breach attacks. You can simulate a breach by &#8220;infecting&#8221; a server with a &#8220;Monkey&#8221; that runs around your network using various methods to enter propagation paths and attacks each point of vulnerability it discovers.</p>

You can remove its skin and are allowed to step inside the organs and see how the nose, larynx, heart, and lungs work together to help us breathe. Imagine how clear your understanding would be after learning this way. That&#8217;s what Orbit does.</p>

          <p>Creating a software system is a lot like constructing a building. If the foundation is not solid, structural problems can undermine the integrity and function of the building. The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architects build the most secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure possible for their applications. This framework provides a consistent approach to evaluate architectures, and provides guidance to implement designs that scale with your application needs over time.</p>

          <p>Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech. Using Amazon Polly you can create applications that talk and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Starting today, you can apply to participate in a developer preview that allows you to use eight English (U.S.) Amazon Polly voices to narrate your Alexa skills. If your skill uses only a single voice today, you can try changing the voice or adding different voices in the right places to provide an even more engaging experience. Developers in the preview can select a different voice for any utterance by constructing output speech using the Structured Speech Markup Language (SSML) and specifying an Amazon Polly voice using the voice tag for free in Alexa skills. Note that SSML tags that are only available through the Amazon Polly service and not through Alexa skills will not be available when you use this new capability.</p>
