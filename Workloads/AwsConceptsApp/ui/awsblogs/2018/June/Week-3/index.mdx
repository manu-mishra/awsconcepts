          <p>Public references are commonly noted as one of the top APN elements that AWS customers look to when selecting an APN Partner. Customers can view validated public references within your AWS Partner Solutions Finder listing under the Case Studies tab, and they use these public references to review an organizations previous success delivering AWS workloads. References not only enhance your visibility with customers, they can prepare your organization to apply for APN Programs such as the AWS Competency Program.</p>

          <p>During my recent visit to Latin America, I was enchanted by the beauty, grace, and passion of tango dance during a show at the Buenos Aires Faena Hotel. The dancers reflect the Argentine people honoring their history, tradition, and culture, but are not afraid to innovate, take chances, and lead. I was also amazed with the beauty of the Andes, delivering strength, power, a quiet peace and gentle inspiration. It is with this backdrop that I met with AWS customers in Latin America to discuss the power of cloud computing.</p>
