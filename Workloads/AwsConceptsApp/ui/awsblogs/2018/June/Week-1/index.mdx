          <p>&#20013;&#25991;&#29256; Starting today, you can leverage unified service discovery for services managed by Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Kubernetes. We recently introduced ECS Service Discovery, which makes it easy for containerized services to discover and connect with each other by creating and managing a registry of service names using the Amazon Route 53 [...]</p>

It&#8217;s all ahead of our Earth &amp; Space on AWS Summit Pre-Day experience, which we&#8217;re over the moon to present on June 19. (Bear with us, we&#8217;re just that excited).</p>

          <p>Parallel processing with multiple GPUs is an important step in scaling training of deep models. In each training iteration, typically a small subset of the dataset, called a mini-batch, is processed. When a single GPU is available, processing of the mini-batch in each training iteration is handled by this GPU. When training with multiple GPUs, [...]</p>

          <p>We have seen a lot of discussion this past week about the role of Amazon Rekognition in facial recognition, surveillance, and civil liberties, and we wanted to share some thoughts.
Amazon Rekognition is a service we announced in 2016. It makes use of new technologies - such as deep learning - and puts them in the hands of developers in an easy-to-use, low-cost way. Since then, we have seen customers use the image and video analysis capabilities of Amazon Rekognition in ways that materially benefit both society (e.g. preventing human trafficking, inhibiting child exploitation, reuniting missing children with their families, and building educational apps for children), and organizations (enhancing security through multi-factor authentication, finding images more easily, or preventing package theft). Amazon Web Services (AWS) is not the only provider of services like these, and we remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world, including in the public sector and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>In this blog post, we focus on how to get analytics out of the rich set of data published by Amazon Connect. We make use of an Amazon Connect data stream and create an end-to-end workflow to offer an analytical solution that can be customized based on need.</p>
