          <p> Starting today, you can leverage unified service discovery for services managed by Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Kubernetes. We recently introduced ECS Service Discovery, which makes it easy for containerized services to discover and connect with each other by creating and managing a registry of service names using the Amazon Route 53 [...]</p>

          <p>Parallel processing with multiple GPUs is an important step in scaling training of deep models. In each training iteration, typically a small subset of the dataset, called a mini-batch, is processed. When a single GPU is available, processing of the mini-batch in each training iteration is handled by this GPU. When training with multiple GPUs, [...]</p>

          <p>We have seen a lot of discussion this past week about the role of Amazon Rekognition in facial recognition, surveillance, and civil liberties, and we wanted to share some thoughts.
Amazon Rekognition is a service we announced in 2016. It makes use of new technologies such as deep learning and puts them in the hands of developers in an easy-to-use, low-cost way. Since then, we have seen customers use the image and video analysis capabilities of Amazon Rekognition in ways that materially benefit both society (e.g. preventing human trafficking, inhibiting child exploitation, reuniting missing children with their families, and building educational apps for children), and organizations (enhancing security through multi-factor authentication, finding images more easily, or preventing package theft). Amazon Web Services (AWS) is not the only provider of services like these, and we remain excited about how image and video analysis can be a driver for good in the world, including in the public sector and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Public references are commonly noted as one of the top APN elements that AWS customers look to when selecting an APN Partner. Customers can view validated public references within your AWS Partner Solutions Finder listing under the Case Studies tab, and they use these public references to review an organizations previous success delivering AWS workloads. References not only enhance your visibility with customers, they can prepare your organization to apply for APN Programs such as the AWS Competency Program.</p>

The dancers reflect the Argentine people honoring their history, tradition, and culture, but are not afraid to innovate, take chances, and lead. I was also amazed with the beauty of the Andes, delivering strength, power, a quiet peace and gentle inspiration. It is with this backdrop that I met with AWS customers in Latin America to discuss the power of cloud computing.</p>

          <p>In May 2015, the CIOs office at the U.S. Department of Interior embarked on a mission to provide a secure, scalable platform for the 32 agencies that make up the Federal Geographic Data Committee. The platform provides a managed services environment for agencies to host and share geospatial data, geospatial services and geospatial applications for the public, and with other government agencies and their partners. DOI names GTRI, now Zivaro, the mission partner. GTRI, an AWS Advanced Technology Partner, specializes in the selection, implementation, deployment, and maintenance of AWS environments.</p>
