          <p>Our customers continue to make very heavy use of Amazon S3. We now process up to 370,000 S3 requests per second. Many of these are PUT requests, representing new data that is flowing in to S3. As of the end of the third quarter of 2011, there are 566 billion (566,000,000,000) objects in S3.
