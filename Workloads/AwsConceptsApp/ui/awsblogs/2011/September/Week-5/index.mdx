          <p>We introduced the Amazon Linux AMI in beta form about a year ago with the goal of providing a simple, stable, and secure Linux environment for server-focused workloads. We&#8217;ve been really happy with the adoption we&#8217;ve seen so far, and we continue to improve the product and further integrate it with other Amazon Web Services [...]</p>

          <p>I never get tired of writing posts that announce price decreases on the various AWS services! Today, we are reducing the price to host a set of DNS records for a domain (which we call a hosted zone) using Amazon Route 53. Here&#8217;s the new pricing structure: $0.50 per hosted zone per month for the [...]</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ll be running a Big Data Hackathon at the SPLASH/OOPSLA Conference in Portland, Oregon next month. Hackathons are participatory event. You don&#8217;t show up to watch or to hang out; you show up to lead or to join a team of other developers to imagine, create, and build something cool and useful in the course [...]</p>

          <p>We&#8217;ve just added an edge location in Brazil (number 20 to be precise) to Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Route 53. This is our first edge location in South America. The new location will speed up references to static and streamed content that are made from locations in South America, and will also accelerate the resolution [...]</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been making a point of telling my live audiences about AWS CloudFormation lately. Many large-scale AWS customers are starting to appreciate the fact that they can describe and instantiate entire application stacks using parameterized templates (see my original CloudFormation blog post for more info), allowing them to create a repeatable process around it. Today [...]</p>
