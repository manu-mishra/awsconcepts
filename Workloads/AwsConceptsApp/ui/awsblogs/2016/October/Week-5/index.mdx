          <p>Let&#8217;s talk about cloud security. Naturally, federal leaders are concerned about the implications of cloud for their applications and the data within them, so security is a top-of-mind issue. Compound that with compliance and regulatory pressures, and you have a recipe for federal IT stress. Broadly, the phrase &#8220;cloud security&#8221; refers to the cloud versions [...]</p>
