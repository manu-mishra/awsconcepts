          <p>Today we are making it even easier to run Flink on AWS as it is now natively supported in Amazon EMR 5.1.0. EMR supports running Flink-on-YARN so you can create either a long-running cluster that accepts multiple jobs or a short-running Flink session in a transient cluster that helps reduce your costs by only charging you for the time that you use.</p>

In just a few minutes, pleasant memories of HAL-9000, B9 (Lost in Space), the original Star Trek Computer, and Rosie (from The [...]</p>

          <p>Computing and data processing within the confines of a data center or office is easy. You can generally count on good connectivity and a steady supply of electricity, and you have access to as much on-premises or cloud-based storage and compute power as you need. The situation is much different out in the real world. [...]</p>
