          <p>ustomers running analytics, stream processing, machine learning, and ETL workloads on personally identifiable information, health information, and financial data have strict requirements for encryption of data at-rest and in-transit. The Apache Spark and Hadoop ecosystems lend themselves to these big data use cases, and customers have asked us to provide a quick and easy way to encrypt data at-rest and data in-transit between nodes in each execution framework.</p>
