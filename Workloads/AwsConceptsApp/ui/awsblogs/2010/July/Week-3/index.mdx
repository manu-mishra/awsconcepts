          <p>We&#8217;ve added two new features to the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to make it more powerful and easier to use. Here&#8217;s the scoop: IP Address Control - You can now assign the IP address of your choice to each of the EC2 instances that you launch in your Virtual Private Cloud. The address must [...]</p>

          <p>A number of AWS users have been using Amazon EC2 to solve a variety of computationally intensive problems. Here&#8217;s a sampling: Atbrox and Lingit use Elastic MapReduce to build data sets that help individuals with dyslexia to improve their reading and writing skills. Systems integrator Cycle Computing helps Varian to run compute-intensive Monte Carlo simulations. [...]</p>

          <p>The AWS Management Console now supports Amazon S3&#8217;s Reduced Redundancy Storage. You can view and change the storage class of an S3 object in the object&#8217;s Properties pane: You can also select multiple objects and change the storage class for all of them at the same time. Finally, you can set the option when you [...]</p>

          <p>We&#8217;re starting to wire various AWS services to each other, with interesting and powerful results. Today I&#8217;d like to talk to you about a brand new connection between Amazon S3 and the Amazon Simple Notification Service. When I introduced you to SNS earlier this year I noted that &#8220;SNS is also integrated with other AWS [...]</p>

          <p>One thing that I love (among many) about working at Amazon.com is the customer-driven innovation cycle. We introduce a new product or service with a useful yet somewhat minimal feature set. We do this to get it out into the real world as soon as possible so that our customers can start to use it [...]</p>

          <p>You can now use the Linux kernel of your choice when you boot up an Amazon EC2 instance. We have created a set of AKIs (Amazon Kernel Images) which contain the PV-Grub loader. This loader simply chain-boots the kernel provided in the associated AMI (Amazon Machine Image). Net-net, your instance ends up running the kernel [...]</p>
