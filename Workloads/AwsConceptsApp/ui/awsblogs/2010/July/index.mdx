          <p>Update August 22, 2011: We are aware of the existence of a tool that scans S3 looking for buckets that allow anonymous users READ permission. Bucket level READ permissions only allow an user to list the objects within a bucket. However, users with the ability to list could probe into the bucket looking for unprotected [...]</p>
