          <p>We have released a new version of the Amazon Linux AMI. The new version includes new features, security fixes, package updates, and additional packages. The AWS Management Console will be updated to use these AMIs in the near future. Users of the existing Amazon Linux AMI can access the package additions and updates through our [...]</p>

          <p>The new release of Auto Scaling gives you better control over the policies used to modify the number of EC2 instances running in one of your AutoScaling groups. Auto Scaling now emits metrics for each AutoScalingGroup. You can use CloudWatch to monitor your group size, instances being launched and terminated, and other group activity. Policies [...]</p>

          <p>The development team likes to call this feature the &#8220;Big Red Button.&#8221; You can use CloudWatch&#8217;s Auto Scaling feature to scale your EC2 capacity up and down according to conditions that you define. You do this by creating an AutoScaling Group and attaching a trigger to it. A trigger uses CloudWatch Alarms to reference a [...]</p>

You can attach multiple Alarms to each metric and each one can have multiple actions. Here&#8217;s how they relate to each other: A CloudWatch Alarm [...]</p>

          <p>Auto Scaling can now take advantage of the instance health information collected by the associated Elastic Load Balancer. Specifically, once a load balancer determines that an instance is unhealthy (using the health checks that were established when the load balancer was created), Auto Scaling can be instructed to terminate the unhealthy instances and to launch [...]</p>
