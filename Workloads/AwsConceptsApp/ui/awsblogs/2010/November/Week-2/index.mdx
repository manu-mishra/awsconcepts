          <p>Amazon CloudFront uses an ever-growing network of edge locations to give your users high speed, low latency access to your content, regardless of where they happen to live. Until now, CloudFront could serve up content from Amazon S3. In content-distribution lingo, S3 was the only supported origin server. You would store your web objects (web [...]</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ll be brief. Two quick yet important Amazon CloudFront announcements: First, we&#8217;ve removed the beta tag from CloudFront and it is now in full production. During the beta period we listened to our customers and added a number of important features including Invalidation, a default root object, HTTPS access, private content, streamed content, private streamed [...]</p>

          <p>Can I ask you some questions? Have you ever been forced to repeatedly try to upload a file across an unreliable network connection? In most cases there&#8217;s no easy way to pick up from where you left off and you need to restart the upload from the beginning. Are you frustrated because your company has [...]</p>

          <p>If you are running a Windows Server 2003 AMI it is most likely S3-backed. If you&#8217;d like to migrate it to an EBS-backed AMI so that you can take advantage of new features such as the ability to stop it and then restart it later, I&#8217;ve got some good news for you. We&#8217;ve just put [...]</p>
