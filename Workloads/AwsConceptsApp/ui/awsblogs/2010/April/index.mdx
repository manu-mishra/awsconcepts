          <p>Today Id like to tell you about our newest service, the Amazon Simple Notification Service.

          <p>Amazon EC2s Elastic Load Balancing feature just became a bit more powerful. Up until now each load balancer had the freedom to forward each incoming HTTP or TCP request to any of the EC2 instances under its purview.
