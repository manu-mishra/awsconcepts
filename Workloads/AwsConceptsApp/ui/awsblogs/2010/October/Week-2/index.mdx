          <p>We are already putting together our 2011 plans for AWS. I can&#8217;t tell you what we are planning to do, but I can tell you that we need to hire some more great people in order to turn these plans into the kinds of amazing services that you have come to expect from us. The [...]</p>

          <p>It is possible to characterize the workload handled by a relational database in terms of the ratio of reads to writes. Some applications seem to use about the same number of reads and writes. Others write a little bit of data and read a lot. This read-heavy behavior is frequently seen in web applications.

          <p>It is always fun to write about price reductions. I enjoy knowing that our customers will find AWS to be an even better value over time as we work on their behalf to lower our own costs and pass the savings along. Effective October 1, 2010 we are reducing the On-Demand and Reserved pricing for [...]</p>
