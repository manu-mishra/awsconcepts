          <p>One of the aspects that attracted me to come work at AWS was my sense that the cloud is becoming a logical place in which to build security solutions.

          <p>It is possible to characterize the workload handled by a relational database in terms of the ratio of reads to writes. Some applications seem to use about the same number of reads and writes. Others write a little bit of data and read a lot. This read-heavy behavior is frequently seen in web applications.
