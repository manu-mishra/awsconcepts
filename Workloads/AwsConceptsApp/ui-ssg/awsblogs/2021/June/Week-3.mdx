          <p>Containers are rapidly maturing within the high performance computing (HPC) community and were excited to be part of the movement: listening to what customers have to say and feeding this back to both the communityandour own product and service teams. Containerization has the potential tounblockHPC environments, so AWS ParallelCluster and container-native schedulers like AWS Batch are moving quickly to reflect the best practices developed by the community and our customers. This year is the seventh consecutive year we are hosting the High Performance Container Workshop at ISC High Performance 2021 conference (ISC21). The workshop will be taking place on July 2nd at 2PM CEST (7AM CST). The full program for the workshop is available on the High Performance Container Workshop page at https://hpcw.github.io/</p>
