None of these systems work together, and the downstream effects dehumanizes the care experience. Olive is designed to connect these disparate parts, shining a new light on old processes, connecting providers delivering care and payers reimbursing that care to ultimately drive a better patient experience.</p>

          <p>In the spring of 2019, environmental modelers at the Lake Michigan Air Directors Consortium (LADCO) had a new problem to solve. Emerging research on air pollution along the shores of the Great Lakes in the United States showed that to properly simulate the pollution episodes in the region we needed to apply our models at a finer spatial granularity than the computational capacity of our in-house HPC cluster could handle. The LADCO modelers turned to AWS ParallelCluster to access the HPC resources needed to do this modeling faster and scale for our member states.</p>

          <p>Originally starting out as a crypto exchange for the Central-Eastern-European region, Budap were soon facing waves of chargebacks that threatened the business.

SEON was essentially founded to tackle all of these problems.</p>

And while women hold 57% of all professional occupations in the US workforce, they hold only 26% of all computing occupations.And, the numbers of women in STEM drop down to the low single digits when you look at BIPOC women.

          <p>According to the IFC, small business ownership in South Africa reflects patterns of racial and gender-based inequality in the broader South African society, and as the size of businesses grows, the rates of black and female ownership decline. At AWS, we believe that building diverse teams allows us to innovate better for our customers. To work toward this, in 2019, AWS South Africa launched the AWS Equity Equivalent Investment Program (AWS EEIP), as part of its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) program. The AWS EEIP is a Partner development and acceleration program for 100% black owned small IT businesses in South Africa. Applications for the 2021 intake are now open.</p>
