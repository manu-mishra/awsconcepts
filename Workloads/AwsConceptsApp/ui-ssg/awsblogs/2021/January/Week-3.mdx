          <p>You can use rules in Amazon CloudWatch Contributor Insights to gain security visibility into your VPC flow logs. The rules analyze flow logs in targeted groups in Amazon CloudWatch Logs and display the Top-N contributors for a given log field or combination of log fields. In this post, Ill show you how to set up CloudWatch Contributor Insight rules for VPC flow logs. Ill demonstrate how to:
Map the VPC flow log format to rules in Contributor Insights.br /
Explain how a single rule can be used to monitor many VPC flow logs.br /
Walk through some sample rules and show them in a CloudWatch dashboard.</p>

          <p>Even though Amazon S3 provides regional data resiliency, customers often have compliance and business requirements to replicate their data to a second Region that is hundreds (or even thousands) of miles away from their primary location. Amazon S3 replication provides an automatic mechanism to make identical copies of your objects in a destination Region of your choice. Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across S3 buckets. Learn how to configure S3 Cross Region Replication with S3 RTC feature, and do a walk-through of how to configure event notification for S3 replication events and configuring Amazon CloudWatch alarms for the replication metrics.</p>
