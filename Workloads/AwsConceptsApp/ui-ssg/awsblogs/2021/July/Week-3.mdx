Purchasing a pre-hardened image is a great option, especially since you are ensured compliance with the CIS Benchmark, and deploying it would not require much maintenance on your end.</p>

          <p>In this post, I introduce some of the core streaming concepts for serverless applications. I explain some of the benefits of streaming architectures and how Kinesis works with producers and consumers. I compare different ways to ingest data, how streams are composed of shards, and how partition keys determine which shard is used. Finally, I explain the payload formats at the different stages of a streaming workload, how message ordering works with shards, and why idempotency is important to handle.</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, AWS support engineers noticed an uptick in customers experiencing Kubernetes API server slowness with their Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) clusters. Seasoned Kubernetes users know that a slow Kubernetes API server is often indicative of a large, overloaded cluster or a malfunctioning controller. Once support engineers ruled out cluster size as [...]</p>
