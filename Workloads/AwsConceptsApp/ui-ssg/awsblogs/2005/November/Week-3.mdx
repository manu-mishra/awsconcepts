          <h3><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/atree_dynamic_a/">A-Tree Dynamic Amazon Catalog Browser</a></h3>
          <p>The A-Tree uses AJAX technology (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) to show the Amazon product catalog in a live, clickable outline. Each click opens up another level of the tree without the need to refresh the page. Products are shown in a popup, again with no need for a page refresh.</p>
