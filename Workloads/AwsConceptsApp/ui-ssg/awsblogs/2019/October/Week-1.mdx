          <p>Public sector organizations are under more pressure than ever to keep data secure, control costs, and empower workers to be more productive. Traditional on-premises tools, such as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), application streaming, and mobile access management software, are hard to secure and lack flexibility and scale. As many organizations are looking at cloud-based solutions to meet their needs, its important to note that there is more to cloud-based end user computing (EUC) projects than simply moving Microsoft Office products to the cloud. Organizations should take a comprehensive look at their strategic needs and challenges when evaluating cloud-based EUC solutions.</p>

          <p>This post discusses installing notebook-scoped libraries on a running cluster directly via an EMR Notebook. Before this feature, you had to rely on bootstrap actions or use custom AMI to install additional libraries that are not pre-packaged with the EMR AMI when you provision the cluster. This post also discusses how to use the pre-installed Python libraries available locally within EMR Notebooks to analyze and plot your results. This capability is useful in scenarios in which you dont have access to a PyPI repository but need to analyze and visualize a dataset.</p>

          <p>The Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance (CGPS) is based at the Wellcome Genome Campus, Cambridge and The Big Data Institute, University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Much of its work involves collaborating with laboratories around the world to enhance genomic surveillance by using big data, engineering, training, and genomic capacity building. Ultimately, the Centre hopes to enable the linking and real-time interpretation of data globally to track pathogens and antimicrobial resistance at an affordable rate. Typically, spikes in cost for research are a common challenge for laboratories. With the cloud, the team wanted to mitigate their costs, and particularly those of their partners in low and middle-income countries, by exploring the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Clouds pay-as-you-go infrastructure.</p>

To stand out companies and brands will need to maximize the value of their content and understand how a story, a posting, a video can be optimized to leverage consumers interest. Identifying and owning the relevant data to achieve this is just the first step in the new workflow. Aiconix, named one of the 30 most promising startups in the German speaking regions by Forbes magazine, is doing just that.</p>
