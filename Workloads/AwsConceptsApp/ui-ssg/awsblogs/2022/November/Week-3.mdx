          <p>To gain operational efficiencies and reduce workload burdens on employees, some state finance and tax agencies are leveraging robotic process automation (RPA) on AWS. RPA is a software tool that integrates with almost any system or application and performs manual, repetitive, time-consuming tasks. Tax agencies can use AI and ML to support the sheer size and scale of data they manage and to access and analyze all types of data with ease, including voice, video, and streaming data. Find out three ways AI and ML are creating measurable outcomes for tax agencies.</p>

          <p>Though their personal experiences in the lab were different, Sara and Gabriel, PhD student, came to the same conclusion: research labs are seriously lacking when it comes to accessibility. Its a pervasive problem not limited to one institution or type of disability. Thats why they decided to collaborate with LabVoicea digital lab assistant platform designed specifically for the research lab. Working together with the LabVoice team, they developed an inventory search solution that allows users to record information, like chemical location and amount, and then retrieve it later entirely through verbal prompts.</p>

          <p>Natural disasters are devastating, often resulting in loss of life, massive property damage, and damage to the critical infrastructure that powers emergency services. This can prompt public sector organizations to consider building more resilient infrastructure. Such was the case for the 911 system in Livingston Parish, Louisiana, an agency that dispatches for 21 public safety agencies including law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services, and averages over 325 calls for service per day. After a major flood in 2016 knocked out their 911 system, they worked with AWS Partner TailorBuilt Solutions, LLC. to use AWS to become resilient against disaster, reducing service interruptions and improving response times.</p>
