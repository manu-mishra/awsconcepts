This funding required sign-off from the US Department of the Treasury to access and the funds needed to be distributed quickly. AWS customer ProLink Solutions supported states with rapidly designing and deploying new programs and workflows, which helped states acquire these funds and quickly deliver them to citizens in need.</p>
