          <p>Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer.

          <p>Organizing, forecasting, and understanding the costs of your disaster recovery (DR) solution is an important part of DR cost optimization and management. Without a breakdown of resource costs, these tasks can be challenging. Allocating tags to resources is a useful strategy to identify and group resources for cost estimation. However, this manual effort becomes more [...]</p>

          <p>Refactor Spaces, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Migration Hub feature, eliminates the undifferentiated work of building and operating AWS infrastructure for incremental application refactoring (typically to microservices using the strangler fig pattern).

          <p>In mid-February of 2022, the US federal government began planning the return-to-office after the COVID-19 pandemic. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) Tax Division needed to quickly build and launch a telework authorization application by April 1, which would help their more than 500 attorneys, paralegals, and administrative personnel request a hybrid work arrangementall while keeping sensitive information compliant and secure. To do this, the DOJ Tax Division worked with AWS to build an enterprise-level telework approval application in less than two months, before the Divisions re-entry in mid-April of 2022.</p>
