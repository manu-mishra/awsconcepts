          <p>We launched EBS Volumes with Provisioned IOPS way back in 2012. These volumes are a great fit for your most I/O-hungry and latency-sensitive applications because you can dial in the level of performance that you need, and then (with the launch of Elastic Volumes in 2017) change it later. Over the years, we have increased [...]</p>

          <p>This post demonstrates how to set up a blockchain application written in Java to read and write data to Managed Blockchain using the Fabric Java SDK. The Java SDK allows customers with applications written in Java to integrate blockchain support with their existing codebase. This makes it easier to handle rich data structures and complex business logic before writing records to the blockchain. You can also integrate Managed Blockchain using the Fabric Node.js SDK. For more information, see Building serverless blockchain application with Fabric Node.js SDK.</p>

          <p>Ecree, an AWS EdStart Member, was founded by educators who believed the way we teach students to write is broken. The volume of work a teacher is being asked to do means students dont always get the necessary attention and feedback required to develop their writing skills. Ecrees founding team set out to support teachers and students by creating the worlds first rules-based tool that assesses student writing in the same way a highly trained professor does, on-demand. The solution uses cloud technologies including machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and voice technology to help improve student writing.</p>

          <p>Leveraging cloud-based microservices is not a solution that works for everyone or every application, but its one more point in favor of transitioning legacy applications to microservices. If youre already looking to re-architect, consider it an opportunity to spin out regulated data into separate containers. From there, its not much more effort to move those containers to AWS. Learn how AWS technologies can help organizations reduce their Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance burden.</p>
