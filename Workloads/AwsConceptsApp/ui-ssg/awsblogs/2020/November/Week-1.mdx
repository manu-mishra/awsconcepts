          <p>Using containers brings flexibility, consistency, and portability in a DevOps culture. One of the essential parts of DevOps is creating Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines that deliver containerized application code faster and more reliably to production systems. Enabling canary or blue-green deployments in CI/CD pipelines provides more robust testing of the new application versions [...]</p>

          <p>You might have heard the adage to tag early, tag often in infrastructure planning and design sessions. Using accurate, meaningful tags on your AWS resources is a best practice. Consistently applied resource tags deliver organizational benefits such as accurate cost allocation, granular access controls, precisely routed operation issues, and simplified resource operating state changes.

          <p>A new agreement between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the UK government will accelerate adoption of cloud computing in the public sector while saving taxpayer money, boosting digital skills across the civil service, and increasing the diversity of suppliers to the government by helping more small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to take part in public sector contracts. The agreement, called the One Government Value Agreement (OGVA), is a three-year, Memorandum of Understanding between AWS and the Crown Commercial Service (CCS). By treating participating UK government and public sector organisations as a single client, it offers greater cost savings for cloud deployments, similar to those available to large commercial customers.</p>

          <p>Today more than 200,000 volunteers around the world are helping accelerate research toward COVID-19 therapiesby walking away from their computers. Thats because of a concept called distributed computing, which allows anyone with a home computer, laptop, or virtual machine to contribute computing power to a common cause. This month, nonprofit Folding@home has started sharing one of the worlds largest public protein simulation databases as an AWS Open Data Set so that researchers around the world can easily access this data to speed up the search for therapies for COVID-19.</p>

          <p>This year, AWS is a gold sponsor of AI for Good, the action-oriented technology-education platform hosted by the United Nations (UN). The organization is delivering a webinar series to provide best practices around how to adopt AI and ML technologies. With less than 10 years remaining to achieve the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, organizations all over the world are using AWS services to deliver various AI and ML-enabled solutionsfrom delivering disaster-relief services at the edge to reconnecting telecommunications after a hurricane. We are also helping organizations adopt AI and ML technologies more readily in the areas of computer vision, automatic speech recognition, and natural language process to solve ongoing global challenges.</p>
