          <p>The deadline to move to SAP S/4HANA was recently extended to 2027. Many companies are in the early stages of evaluating how and when to make this upgrade. For many organizations, the decision to adopt the cloud for their enterprise deployments is in the rear view mirror. Thus, migrating SAP to the cloud first, and then pursuing the upgrade to S/4HANA later, may be the best course of action for your company.</p>

          <p>Cloud-based technologies allow organizations like governments to build a new application on existing services on the internet that offers open and documented APIs to deliver reliable data. These services have an authentication model so that new users verify their identity before accessing, even if its offered at no cost. There are three components in this scenario: a service provider, an end user, and an application that needs to access user data. The key technology here is OAuth. OAuth is a standard that enables access delegation.</p>
