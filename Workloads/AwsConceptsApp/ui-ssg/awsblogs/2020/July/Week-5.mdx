          <p>As a physical oceanographer focused on remote sensing, Dr. Chelle Gentemann, senior scientist at Farallon Institute, has worked for over 20 years on retrievals of ocean temperature from space. She uses measurements of sea surface temperature from satellites to understand how the ocean impacts our lives. Chelles work requires analysis of large volumes of data, which requires access to large data storage and computational resources. Although most large research institutions can secure those IT resources, that is not the case for smaller organizations or underserved communities around the world. As part of theAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative, we invited Dr. Gentemann to share her perspective on the value of hosting high-resolution climate data on AWS.</p>

          <p>There are many ways to connect your data centers to Amazon Web Services. This blog post answers a few common questions that customers ask us when trying to build a communications path over AWS Direct Connect (DX). In particular, how to create active passive Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connections with AWS over Direct Connect. To [...]</p>

          <p>Nowadays, risk of spreading disease is a key concern in hospitals, where doctors, nurses and other caregivers are on the front lines helping patients. Hospitals have started using robots in daily operations such as contactless delivery and room disinfection to reduce risk of spreading disease. As the need for robots in healthcare grows, better tools are needed to build, test, and deploy robotics applications quickly and safely. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has developed a Gazebo simulated Hospital World and published it as open source so that robotics companies within the Healthcare industry can more easily test their robots in a simulated hospital environment. In this blog, I will provide an overview of the hospital and share my experience using it to test a PR2 robot, including software failures that I encountered that you may find helpful.</p>

          <p>At AWS, we understand migrating your data is not trivial, especially migrating out of tenured, familiar data storage solutions. It can involve serious and tedious work in designing, planning, and executing your data migration project plan, plus having a contingency plan in place in case of any hiccups. There are both technical and business risks [...]</p>
