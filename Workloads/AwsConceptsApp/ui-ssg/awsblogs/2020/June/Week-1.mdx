          <p>Government agencies and public sector organizations in energy and utilities rely on smart solutions to detect, locate, and fix utilities outages faster based on input from their customer contact centers and field crews. One popular outage management solution (OMS) is Schneider Electrics ArcFM Responder (Responder) OMS. In this post, we discuss how to deploy the Schneider Electrics Responder environment on AWS.</p>
