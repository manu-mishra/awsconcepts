          <p>Introduction In this blog post, I show you how you can track and enforce licensing for your IBM software products running on AWS or on-premises. IBM licenses many of its products using a processor-based licensing approach by Processor Value Units (PVU).

          <p>One of the security best practices that is time-consuming to manage is enforcing IAM access key rotation for IAM users.

The DoD estimates that more than 300,000 organizations will require certification. In addition, other U.S. federal agencies and international organizations may adopt a similar framework to protect their intellectual property (IP). No matter the size of your organization, cloud-based services can help you meet the requirements of CMMC.</p>

          <p>We often have data processing requirements in which we need to merge multiple datasets with varying data ingestion frequencies. Some of these datasets are ingested one time in full, received infrequently, and always used in their entirety, whereas other datasets are incremental, received at certain intervals, and joined with the full datasets to generate output. To address this requirement, this post demonstrates how to build an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline using AWS Glue.</p>

Some time ago, I published running Ansible playbooks using Systems Manager blog when the first version of the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) document was released, which enabled support for Ansible. In that blog, I discussed the tight integration of [...]</p>

          <p>Customer managed encryption keys are a common architecture requirement within highly regulated workloads. This post demonstrates how to satisfy this requirement within Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), including Amazon S3 Glacier. We also clarify some common points of confusion and demonstrate how objects can be uploaded directly to Amazon S3 Glacier via Amazon S3, which can help meet regulatory requirements as well as potentially save budget.</p>
