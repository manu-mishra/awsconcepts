          <p>We parse through millions of scooter and user events generated daily (over 300 events per second) to extract actionable insight. We selected AWS Glue to perform this task. Our primary ETL job reads the newly added raw event data from Amazon S3, processes it using Apache Spark, and writes the results to our Amazon Redshift data warehouse. AWS Glue plays a critical role in our ability to scale on demand. After careful evaluation and testing, we concluded that AWS Glue ETL jobs meet all our needs and free us from procuring and managing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The First Street Foundation is dedicated to communicating the flood and inundation risks posed by a changing environment, with an emphasis on allowing Americans to discover and understand those risks. By building awareness, our hope is that every individual is empowered to take steps to reduce their risk exposure to flooding, as well as that of their communitiestoday and in the future. First Street created a nationwide assessment of flood risk for the CONUS and DC, and is now sharing that assessment through Flood Factor.</p>

While RDS Proxy supports both MySQL as well as PostgreSQL engines, in this post, we will use a MySQL test workload to demonstrate how RDS Proxy reduces client recovery time after failover by up to 79% [...]</p>

          <p>This post demonstrates how to extend the Lake Formation security model to QuickSight users and groups, which allows data lake administrators to manage data catalog resource permissions centrally from one console. As organizations embark on the journey to secure their data lakes with Lake Formation, having the ability to centrally manage fine-grained permissions for QuickSight authors can extend the data governance and enforcement of security controls at the data consumption (business intelligence) layer. You can enable these fine-grained permissions for QuickSight users and groups at the database, table, or column level, and theyre reflected in the Athena dataset in QuickSight.</p>

          <p>With AWS Direct Connect, the internet is bypassed entirely and customers get physical dedicated connectivity to AWS, allowing for a more consistent, predictable performance. Many customers rely on Direct Connect Partners to get access to Direct Connect connections so they can connect to AWS. These trusted AWS Partners have passed a technical validation for following AWS service best practices, and have proven success delivering AWS services like Direct Connect to customers.</p>

          <p>Hospitalization can be an isolating and stressful experience. This is especially true now, as the pandemic has led hospitals to impose even stricter visitation and distancing procedures. To help make kids stays a bit brighter, AWS is teaming up with GameChanger Charity to donate GameChangers patient engagement platform, Playwell, for one year to select hospitals across the U.S. We are starting with Seattle Childrens Hospitala hospital that Taylor spent considerable time in during his battle with cancerand will announce additional hospitals in the coming weeks and months. With this donation, we hope to bring entertainment and joy to anywhere from 75 to 200 kids per day per hospital.</p>
