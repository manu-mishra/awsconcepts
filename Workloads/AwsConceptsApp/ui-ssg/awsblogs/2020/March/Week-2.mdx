          <p>At some point in any database migration, the bandwidth of your network becomes a limiting factor. Without available high-speed internet links, it can take months to transfer large amounts of data. For example, 100 terabytes of data takes more than 100 days to transfer over a dedicated 100-Mbps connection. Many times, if you are in [...]</p>

          <p>As application complexity increases, the debugging process in production environments gets more complicated as well. AWS understands this challenge and includes tracing tools in its cloud services. For instance, AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. Epsagonspecializes in automated tracing for cloud microservices, providing automated end-to-end tracing across not distributed AWS services.</p>

          <p>In this blog post, we describe a cloud native approach to demonstrate the power and capabilities of AWS. There are still good reasons for HANA System Replication (HSR) or third-party cluster software to build productive systems in cloud environments. However, we focus on an alternative approach by using cloud native features, such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) Snapshots. With these features we build an infrastructure with native backup/restore functionality, automated processes, and the focus of low costs, for non-critical SAP applications.</p>
