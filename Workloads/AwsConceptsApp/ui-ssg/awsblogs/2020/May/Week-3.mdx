We describe how Glue ETL jobs can utilize the partitioning information available from AWS Glue Data Catalog to prune large datasets, manage large number of small files, and use JDBC optimizations for partitioned reads and batch record fetch from databases. You can use some or all of these techniques to help ensure your ETL jobs perform well.</p>
