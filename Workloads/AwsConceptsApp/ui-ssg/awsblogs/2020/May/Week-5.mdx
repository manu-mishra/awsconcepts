          <p>This post demonstrates how you can automate the data extraction, transformation, and use of Forecast for the use case of a retailer that requires recurring replenishment of inventory. You achieve this by using AWS Lake Formation to build a secure data lake and ingest data into it, orchestrate the data transformation using an AWS Glue workflow, and visualize the forecast results in Amazon QuickSight.</p>
